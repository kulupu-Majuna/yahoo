>Toki, Sonja! I'm just curious as to what you think of amore "minimilistic" trivocalic system (a/i/u or a/i/o) over a five-vowel system (a/e/i/u/o). I think a trivocalic language is cute.There are some languages in the world that do well with just threevowels. Imagine two less phonemes!It seems to me that the trouble over "ike" and "iki" was due to theallure of a trivocalic system.--
