Just because one understandsEnglish and can write an email or two in it,doesn't mean that person can fully participate ina conversation. He or she may give up sending amessage because it would take too long to write orperhaps just because of a lack of confidence. Ifyou think that everyone should be able toparticipate nearly equally, then this isn't agreat solution. Particularly if you also thinkthat people who don't speak English at all mighthave something to contribute and should bewelcome.I don't know what is a good solution, given thatwe already have a community here (and it may notbe fair to let newcomers in on the conversation atthe expense of excluding any existing members whoonly speak English, say). I don't know that Ihave the effort to write my messages in multiplelanguages, say, both in English and Esperanto.Personally, I don't mind seeing posts in anylanguage at all, even ones I don't understand. Idon't find it impolite. So letting everyone posthowever they want works for me.
