Let me repeat my suggestion from some weeks ago: when it is necessary to distingiush "friend" from "good person", I would say: ona li jan pona mi = she's/he's my friend, and ona li jan pona = he/she is a good person. jan ElumutuJohn E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\
