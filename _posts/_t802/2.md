Thanks for writing a section of my paper for me!While it is possible to take the lists I (and many others) are generating asrecords of whatpeople have done in various situations, the fact is that once a reasonablysatisfactory expressionfor a concept has been generated, the willingness to create new ones diminishesquickly to null.That is, good coinages (or on-the-fly solutions) tend to become idioms, itemstaken as as fixed asa word in the original list (when was the last time someone mentioned a friendwith anything otherthan "jan pona"?). The orthodox jtp (and the conservatives in their orthodoxmode) ought, then,object to these lists from the get-go; using these lists suggests radicaltendencies. For allthat, I think it is a good idea to build these lists, for the record but notjust as exemplars.On natural kinds and subtypes. Toki pona just isn't English (or French or ...),thus exactcorrespondences for the basic natural kinds of critters do not correspondprecisely to basic sortsfor SAE vocabulary. As far as I can figure out, things run like this: pipi aresmall generallyannoying or dangerous things, waso fly, kala live in water almost entirely,akesi are small (butlarger than pipi generally) and ugly, soweli are larger land-based animals whichare readilyanthropomorphized. Clearly, there are overlaps, so when making a way of talkingabout some ofthese, which order things are put in (deliberately ambiguous) will dependheavily on context: whenit is flying we want bats to do, they are some sort of waso, when they are justhanging incaves,they are some sort of soweli.akesi palisa snakeakesi poka turtleakesi telo frog, amphibianakesi waso pterodactyl many alternatives to pick amongale ma earth's lifeali Lifeanpa ala below zero negative numberante e toki translateijo lon tawa animal many alternatives to pick amongijo musi gift, trinketijo pana olin l ove giftijo tawa pi ken moli animal many alternatives to pick amongilo computer programilo kalama (pi toma tawa) horn (of a car)ilo kiwen pi pakala kasi axilo lukin x-ray or sonic scannerilo lukin telescope, microscope, spectaclesilo lukin (pi lipu sona) browser (the computer again?)ilo moku knifeilo pi tawa kon wingsilo tu lili jacknifeilo utala weapon, swordindirect question like indirect quote: toki e ni: S?jan ike pi tomo tawa telo pirate, Viklngjan meli olin wifejan mu animal many alternatives to pick amongjan pi sona kasi orchard keeperjan seme anybody (it doesn't matter who), a personjan sewi godjan son pi kulupu jan sociologistskala ko j ellyfish many alternatives to pick amongkala pi luka linja mute j ellyfish many alternatives to pick amongkala pi luka palisa squid many alternatives to pick amongkala pi luka wawa crab many alternatives to pick amongkala pi pana pi telo pimeja squid many alternatives to pick amongkala pi selo kiwen crab many alternatives to pick amongkala pi tawa monsi crab many alternatives to pick amongkala pi waso lili flying fish many alternatives to pick amongkala sike jellyfish many alternatives to pick amongkala soweli suli whale many alternatives to pick amongkala waso flying fish many alternatives to pick amongkalama lili sound (phoneme)kalama musi uta singkalama mute ike noise, racketkama occurkama sona e (person) meetkama wile turned on, began to lust, â€¦kasi ike tobaccokasi nasa herb or some sort, aphrodisiacken jan human rightsken lukin t ransparent felt wantingken sona reasonkepeken e kasi ike smoke (v)kili jelo pearkili loje applekiwen lukin transparent felt wantingkiwen pi telo mama cheese?ko moku pi telo mama cheeseko suwi honeyko telo pi telo mama yogurtkon soul/spiritkon sona ??kulup toki Jaju list group Yahookulupu mani company, corporationkulupu pi lipu sona web site (collection of pages)kulupu pi pali toki language creaation societykulupu sitelen alphabet (writing system)kulupu toki forumkute sona understand (when hearing)kute tawa listen to just "kute e"?lili mute very fewlinja pilin tan A tawa B relationship between a and Blipu ijo mirror sheet showing thingslipu kiwen pi telo mama cheese slicelipu pali home work, work sheetslipu pi tawa kon wing --
