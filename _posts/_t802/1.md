Clearly, there are overlaps, so when making a way of talking about some ofthese, which order things are put in (deliberately ambiguous) will depend heavily on context: whenit is flying we want bats to do, they are some sort of waso, when they are just hanging incaves,they are some sort of soweli.I think what the animal is doing at the moment is not nearly as important as what the animal habitually or typically does.  So a bat that is hanging is still a waso, even though it's not flying at the moment.  Birds that are walking or swimming (especially submerged) are still waso, no?  Pipi that fly are still pipi, too, right?stevo / jan Setepo
