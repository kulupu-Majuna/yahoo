I don't know... if someone is truly a friend, that person is a goodperson to you. And good people may be good, but they aren't yourgood people.In English, one can say, "Sarah is a friend," and you wouldunderstand that Sarah is a friend of the person talking. But if youjust looked at the words, all you would know is that she's someone'sfriend; you might ask, "A friend of whom?"In Toki Pona, "jan Sawa li jan pona" would sound strange; it wouldmake more sense to say, instead, "jan Sawa li pona." But if you wantto say that Sarah is your friend, you can say, "jan Sawa li jan ponami." This would translate literally to "Sarah is my good person."Even in English, it would be understood that Sarah is the friend ofthe speaker.So, I don't really see a need to change "jan pona."jan Sosuwa---
