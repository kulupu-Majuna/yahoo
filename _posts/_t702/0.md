I'm noticing a few things:1) People are using "pi" for relative clauses, as in "ilo pi kama len linja."  So, could we say, "ilo jan pi pilin pona luka luka pi anpa lukin sona pi toki lawa" as someone suggested?2) I've seen "luka pi luka" for the number 25.  Could we use "pi" for multiplication in general, just as we say "2/3 of 4/5" to mean "2/3 times 4/5," so that we could have "tu tu pi luka" for "20," "tu wan pi luka pi luka" for 75, etc.?  Any ambiguities resulting from this could be cleared using "en," so 67 could be "tu pi luka pi luka en tu wan pi luka \[or luka luka luka if you prefer\] en tu" (2x5x5+(2+1)x5+2).  Thus TP would have a base 5 system.  125 could be "luka pi luka pi luka" or "luka lon wawa tu wan" (the word for "power" being used for the exponent is also done in French, so it's not limited to English).  The only problem would be how to write fractions.  Maybe "tu lon wan" for 1/2?3) Though peopleare proposing different scripts for TP, the Roman alphabet seems to be winning.  Since the Roman alphabet is read from left to right, could "left" be "nasin pini" and "right" be "nasin kama?"  Thus "north" could be "nasin kama pi tawa suno" and "south" could be "nasin pini pi tawa suno."I like "kule pi telo wawa" for "brown."  It's like the Japanese "chairo" (lit. "tea-color").jan Sosuwa Looking for earth-friendly autos? Browse Top Cars by "Green Rating" at Yahoo! Autos' Green Center.
