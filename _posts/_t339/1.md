 I still love you. / I really love you.

 I love you too.

So you would only say "mi kin tawa ma Elopa" (thesubject only being "mi", the speaker). It is true that "mi mute" takes"li" but that is because the subject is not the speaker "mi" but severalpeople including the speaker, not just because "mi" is being modified. \*Muke!--
