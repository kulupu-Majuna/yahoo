I have another worry.In lesson 12, the work "kin" is introduced, with these possibletranslations: indeed, still, too, also.These are the examples in the lesson text: 1. mi tawa ma Elopa. --
 I went to Europe. pona! mi kin tawa ma Elopa. --
 Cool! I also went to Europe. 2. mi mute o tawa. --
 Let's go. mi ken ala. mi kin moku. --
 I can't. I'm still eating. 3. a! sina lukin ala lukin e ijo nasa ni? --
 Whoa! Do you see thatweird thing? mi kin lukin e ona. --
 I see it indeed.And this example is in the exercise: mi olin kin e sina. --
 I still love you. / I love you too.I don't seem to be clever enough to deduce a rule from those examples.Most words in Toki Pona come after the thing they modify, and if thesubject "mi" is modified, you need "li". From that I would haveexpected: 1. mi kin li tawa ma Elopa. 2. mi moku kin. 3. mi kin li lukin e ona. mi olin kin e sina. --
 I still love you. / I really love you. mi kin li olin e sina. / mi olin e sina kin. --
 I love you too.Unfortunately, there's not much overlap between my expectations andthe examples in the lesson.Can anyone help?
