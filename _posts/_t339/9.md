>you are right and i agree entirely! i can understand "mi pilin pona"as an economical form of "mi li pilin pona". this still preservesthe function of li as an introducer rather than a separator. (whichmore accurately describes the actual usage of li imho)and yes... i have probably over-analysed things... (as i said, i amplanning to use tp to teach students the grammar of computerlanguages!)... but i am happy to accept that the "correct" form ofany language is the form that is in common usage... that i why iprobably wouldn't say "ona pilin pona" although that is just aseconomical and understandable as "mi pilin pona"
