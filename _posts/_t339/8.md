>> It also explains the use of li in sentences like "mi pilin ike LI
> lape". (which would be "mi li pilin ike li lape")You're looking for logic where there's none.Toki pona is not a programming language."li" is omitted when S is "mi" or "sina" because there's no need for it. Itdoesn't matter what the function of "li" is. If it were a "introducer" like yousuggest, it could still be omitted because humans aren't computers and wouldunderstand everything anyway. "li" is omitted due to linguistic principles ofeconomy.And I do believe that saying "mi li pilin pona" is perfectly correct anyway...Nikita\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Check out the new Yahoo!
