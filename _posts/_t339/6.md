(edmund: estis bonega surprizo legi vin cxi tie ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") kama pona!)i too feel that we ought to say:"mi kin li... mi taso li.. mi mute li..."but for a slightly different reason. It's because i think we shouldsay "mi li... " i.e. use li for first and second person too...i have argued this before with Pije and failed miserably to convincehim...i do understand the necessity of li as a separator for clarity(e.g.between sentences like "jan li pona lukin" and "jan pona li lukin")i do appreciate that this ambiguity seldom occurs when you use "mi"or "sina"(i wonder if the same applies for "ona". we do say "ona li ponalukin" although i doubt "ona pona lukin" is anymore ambiguousthan "mi pona lukin")but i prefer to see li not as a separator but as an introducer, aword that introduces a verbal phrase.(similarly i like to think of e as a word that introduces an objectphrase rather than a seperator between verb and object)i.e. rather than see the structure of the sentence "pipi li jaki" as<subject
> li <verb
> i would prefer to see it as <subject
> <verb
>where the verb is "li jaki" (i.e. the purpose of "li" is not toseparate the object and the verb, it is to make "jaki" a verb.)such a view imho greatly simplifies the overall grammar of thelanguage (i am planning to use tp to teach BNF to computing studentslater this year, so i kind of have a vested interest).It also explains the use of li in sentences like "mi pilin ike LIlape". (which would be "mi li pilin ike li lape")agneau
