Heh, I think my cow-orker Ivo already proposed that to Google and theydidn't seem interested. But it certainly couldn't hurt to try again...However, I was doing some Esperanto localization for them last year andnoticed that there is a WHOLE LOT of text that was already translated toEsperanto but wasn't even showing up on the Eo version of google. So Iemailed them to ask what's up with that, and said I was excited to helplocalize google to other languages but didn't want to be spending the timeif the translations weren't actually going to be used. Sadly, they neverwrote back. ![:(](images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad") So I theorize maybe the i18n dept of google is inactive orterribly slow or dissolved or something. Does anyone know more info aboutthis?russ
