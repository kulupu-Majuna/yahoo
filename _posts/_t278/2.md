jan Jim o, pona! tenpo ali la sina pali e ijo sona pi toki pona. miwile toki e ni tawa sina: sina ken ala kepeken e "pi" tu lon toki.Nice job, Jim! You're always coming up with interesting linguisticstuff for TP. One thing: you can't use two pi's to modify a word. Atleast, I'm pretty sure you can't. Double check the lesson on Pije'ssite.[http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/learn/lesson0.htmlI%27m](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/learn/lesson0.htmlI%27m) pretty sure that's the link. Can't say for sure off the top ofmy head.-jan Kowijan lawa pi lipu "www.tokipona.bravehost.com"o lukin e lipu mi!
