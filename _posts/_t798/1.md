That's exactly what I thought. A flying fish remains a fish even when it swims in the water, and a bat remains a mammal even when hanging around in a cave. Likewise, a pterodactyl is first of all a reptile and secondly able to fly.So, for me the logical order seems clear: at first the animal class (pipi, kala, akesi, waso, soweli) followed by the specification (things like palisa, waso, suwi, wawa, etc.) jan ElumutuMarcos CRUZ <[tokipona@alinome.net](mailto://tokipona@alinome.net)\

In that case it's clear: "kala waso" (flying fish) or "kala pi waso lili" (fish that is a bit like a winged animal).And some lizards can "fly" while jumping. And some monkeys look like bats and can "fly down" a bit...The combinations are countless. The contexts are countless :-)ali li pona.jan Mako--
