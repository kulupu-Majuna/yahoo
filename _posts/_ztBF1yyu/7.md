Connections with map and writing conventions are a bit worrisome, since they vary a good deal from culture to culture (and some cultures have none, of course). But no system for directional notions seems totally safe from these comments. And there are those in kulupu pi toki pona who would argue that the tp world would not use them anyhow (cf 'big' numbers).

I prefer to say "poka pi suno kama" for right; "poka pi suno weka"  
for left, since we are talking about left and right.  
After all, if we look at a world map, east will point to our right;  
west, to our right.  
  
As for north and south, I belive "lete" and "seli" (aside from cold  
and hot) are used for north and south regardless of the locations of  
the speaker and the person spoken to.
