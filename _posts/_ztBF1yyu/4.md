I read somewhere about this Australian Aboriginal language that has no  
words for "left" and "right," but uses north/south/east/west/etc. instead.  
  
So for that, we could say "nasin lete" for north and "nasin seli" for  
south (reverse those if you're in the Southern Hemisphere, and if  
you're talking to someone in the other hemisphere by phone or e-mail,  
you could say "nasin pi ma Antasika" for "south"); west could be  
"nasin suno" (because that's the direction the sun goes), and east  
could be "nasin monsi suno" ("the direction behind the sun").  
  
Or if you like "left" and "right," how about "nasin sitelen" for  
"right" and "nasin pi sitelen Alapi" for "left?" (If you're talking  
to someone whose language reads right-to-left, say "nasin pi sitelen  
Loma" for "right.")
