It does seem to come up often enough though... for something to stick it think it would  
have to be simple and (relatively) universal, and not reliant on memorizing a convention  
like one/two open/closed.  
  
'poka pilin' for left seems to return enough to prove useful.  
  
I think something like 'poka pali' could work as a compliment, since most people (myself  
excluded) seem to be right-handed.  
  
personally I'm not a fan of adding 'ala' as a solution for creating a compliment.  
  
Cardinal directions seem much harder to translate into satisfying toki pona. There is a  
tendency in many languages to ascribe colors to directions. This could create a simple  
solution, but again requires memorizing an arbitrary system.  
  
As I understand it, using "North East South West: instead of "Left, Right" means directions  
are given regardless of the speakers position, and not that Left is referred to as West, and  
Right as East. This works for instance in giving directions to one's house, but not mean  
the "top right corner of a piece of paper" is "North-East" Does anyone else have a feeling  
on that?  
  
just my 2 cents- jan Josan

good deal from culture to culture (and some cultures have none, of course). But no system  
for directional notions seems totally safe from these comments. And there are those in  
kulupu pi toki pona who would argue that the tp world would not use them anyhow (cf  
'big' numbers).
