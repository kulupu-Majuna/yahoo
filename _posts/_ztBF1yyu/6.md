I prefer to say "poka pi suno kama" for right; "poka pi suno weka"  
for left, since we are talking about left and right.  
After all, if we look at a world map, east will point to our right;  
west, to our right.  
  
As for north and south, I belive "lete" and "seli" (aside from cold  
and hot) are used for north and south regardless of the locations of  
the speaker and the person spoken to.
