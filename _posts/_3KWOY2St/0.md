I have attempted to translate Eliazar Parra Cardenas 'TP in 76 Illustrated Lessons' from Spanish into English. You can download my translation at this URL:  
  
https://aiki.pbworks.com/f/tp+in+76+lessons+English.pdf  
  
My Spanish is practically non-existant (I relied heavily on Google's translation tools, so there may be better translations in English) and I am just learning TP, so all comments and corrections are welcome. I tried to keep the English translation as close to Eliazar's original text as possible. If anyone has the time or inclination, the following lessons in particular could stand a review:  
37 - pata  
43 - kan  
56, 57, 58 - seme  
71, 72 - la  
and 50 - numbers - I know luka has been deprecated, but I like to use it for 5 as well.  
  
I was a bit lazy at the end and substituted a TP to English dictionary in the appendix, instead of translating the TP to Spanish dictionary. I hope this is ok.  
  
Eliazar's original text is available at:

I will add any corrections that I receive.  
Thanks,
