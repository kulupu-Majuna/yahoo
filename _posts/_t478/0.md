Well even if you're not looking for love, and just a bit of fun thought I'd giveyou all this tip. So you can stay away from all the BS fake profiles places.This is what I've been using [http://www.thedatesite.info/ikro](http://www.thedatesite.info/ikro) . No joke, I'vemessaged about 5 women close to me and already 3 have responded, and I amalready organising to meet up with one. Not bad for a guy who hasn't had a datein a while, lol! ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
