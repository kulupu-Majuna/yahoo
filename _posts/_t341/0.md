For those of you who don't use adblocking tools, you probably havenoticed the massive, hideous white frame things on all my Geocities pages.Although I normally don't see these because I have an adblocker, Iabsolutely abhor the fact that some visitors to my page have totolerate that. It looks especially bad if you're using 800x600resolution (which about 32% of my visitors use).I'm considering moving my site to freewebs.comAs an example, I put up the main page there. [http://www.freewebs.com/tokipona](http://www.freewebs.com/tokipona)(Note: The only working link is the images one.)Good things about freewebs: It has 40 mb of space (Geocities has 15,and my site uses almost 14.). And no ads.Maybe bad: I'm not sure how much bandwidth Geocities allows for, but anumber of times my site has exceeded it. Freewebs allows 500mb/month.I think Geocities allows more. Not sure, but if that's the case, mysite might be down more often.I'm also considering using [http://www.port5.comDo](http://www.port5.comDo) you think I should move the site or not, and if so, where to? I'mtaking your comments. If you don't want the whole message board tohave to get the emails, you can email me directly at bknight009 atyahoo.comPije
