The Wikipedia article is currently still at it's provisional place: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xoloz/Toki_PonaBefore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xoloz/Toki_PonaBefore) it can be moved back to it's proper URL, all its content needs to be verified by sources. This has been done almost completely. The only claims that still need verification are the following four:\* The language is simple enough that most of its syntax can be expressed in fewer than a dozen lines of Extended Backus-Naur form.\* Ideally, the aim of Toki Pona is to reduce all noun phrases to just the core noun itself; through context, a noun phrase initially introduced as jan utala suli pi pona lukin (handsome important soldier) would eventually be reduced through context to jan.\* There is no true passive voice in Toki Pona.\* The 118-word vocabulary is designed around the principles of living a simple life without the complications of modern civilization.(I know that these claims are true; the problem is just that we need some sources that verify their truth).Until now the sources used are tokipona.org, jan Pije's lessons, Yerrick's article, the Globa end MAil article and the Computerra article. If you can find some place on these sites or in these article that verifies one of these claims, please let me know. Other serious Toki Piona websites and articles can also be used as sources.If we don't have sources for these four claims, we will have to remove them from the Wikipedia article. jan Moku
