toki!Following the deletion review that I started after the Globe and Mail article appeared, the Wikipedia article has been restored. But it isn't in the article name space yet, but at the address [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xoloz/Toki_Pona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xoloz/Toki_Pona) . There we have to edit it in such a way that all dubitable claims are supported by references. Only then will it be moved back into the article name space. I have already edited it a bit, but there is still a lot to be done. I hope that some of you can help with that.jan Moku
