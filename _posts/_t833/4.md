Wikipedia policy is often misunderstood. I suggest you read [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability) , [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources) . It's not about whether something is published "the old way" or "the new way": A blog of an expert in a field would be considered a more reliable source than a traditional newspaper article written by a non-expert journalist. Those policies in the English Wikipedia are necessary for the functioning of the wiki principle, and we are starting to implement them into the Esperanto Wikipedia too. In the case of Toki Pona, tokipona.org can be quoted as a primary source (normally Wikipedia avoids primary sources, but allows them under certain conditions). jan Pije's lessons can be quoted, because jan Pije can be considered an "established expert" on Toki Pona. This is additionally supported by the fact that tokipona.org currently reccomends jan Pije's lesson. jan Moku
