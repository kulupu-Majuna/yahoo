I've been away for quite a long time.Unfortunately, I've been extremely busy and haven't been able to post,update my site, or even THINK about Toki Pona for quite some time. ButI'm back now!Soccer season is finally over and I think I should be back. I don'tknow how active I'll be able to be (what with holiday season comingand more busy times), but I'll try to at least CHECK the boardsomewhat frequently.As for the present condition of my website ([http://www.tokipona.bravehost.com](http://www.tokipona.bravehost.com)), I haven't even looked at it in ages. I've just been that busy.Hopefully I'll be able to get back into the groove of updating it, butgive me some time. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") If anyone has any suggestions, please e-mail me([n649po@yahoo.com](mailto://n649po@yahoo.com)).Well, it's great to be back! I can't promise I'll be here forever butI'll enjoy it while it lasts!God bless,Dios te bendida,Corey Farr
