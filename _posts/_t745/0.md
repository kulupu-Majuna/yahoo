In fact I did'nt paymuch attention to its history, movement or schools (I just startedstuding "velcli befi la lojban. bei li co'a cilre" and ".i la lojban.mo"). I can imagine that all about the Lojban goals is not so simpleto describe.

> if the numbers involved get at all large.I know, I tried. I just meant easy to write down and read.Let me explain myself with a comparation:TP already has a nice and easy system to name(almost?) "everything"... though using long expressions and resigningto lack of nuances. Right? You sure can find a expresion to mean"satellite" or "recumbent tandem"... and (hopefully:-) they would beunderstood in their context. But TP is not supposed to be used tocare about such complicated modern things. So, yo have thepossibility to name them, but really it's not very practical becausethe language is not focused on that. Ok?Now, in the same way, why not a simple system just to representnumbers (that are all around in life, more than satellites andrecumbents)? The fact that such a system could exist, does not meanthat the language is supposed to really manage numbers or makecalculations, for example. The possibility to write and read "2007"in TP is not different (in my opinion, if I understand well the TPspirit, I hope so) from the possibility to write and read conceptslike "satellite" and "recumbent tandem": all those things belong tothe "modern" world out there, far away from the TP philosophy andgoals... The difference is that, while I could say, with limitations,"recumbent bike" if I need so (and that would not made me an outcast,I hope), I have no chance to write a one simple year number...What do you think about that point of view?\[ toki e pi sike tu la, mi wile e ni:sina mute lukin e sike tu supa mi.mi kin pali e ona. lipu sona ona lon ni:[http://alinome.net/bici/con_bici01.eo.html](http://alinome.net/bici/con_bici01.eo.html) \]
