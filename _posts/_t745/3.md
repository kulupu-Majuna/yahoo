if I understand well the TP spirit, I hope so) from the possibility to write and read concepts like "satellite" and "recumbent tandem": all those things belong to the "modern" world out there, far away from the TP philosophy and goals... The difference is that, while I could say, with limitations, "recumbent bike" if I need so (and that would not made me an outcast, I hope), I have no chance to write a one simple year number...'Satellite' is "mun".  'Recumbent bike' is a form of tool (ilo) used for going (tawa) with two wheels (sike tu).  I'm not sure how to incorporate the 'recumbent' part.  I think the best thing is for each person to either not use large numbers, thus enjoying the (possible) benefit of such a mental exercise, or to use large numbers, (preferably as numerals only, since Toki Pona has no words for most digits).  Everyone who encounters the numbers will understand them, and everyone who encounters the lack of numbers will not miss them.jan Setepo / stevo
