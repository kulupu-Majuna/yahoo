Would you, however, be content with merely a set of digitnames, adjectivalto, say "sike suno" but usable as quantifiers? I don't think I would be, thoughgetting at leastthose would be a start.

It raises an interestingquestion: does"kin," which might be taken as having only phonological significance, notinterfere with theexception for "mi"? That is, should it be "mi kin LI pali"? I'm pretty sure itshould be "lipusona ona LI lon." I am not sure tp allows for subjectless sentences, so I am notsure what "tokie" means exactly (oni diras?, but on any version of the rule, "e pi" doesn'twork --
 somethingomitted, but I can't supply it from context. I suppose that "toki e" is meantto be for "talksabout," since I can't think what saying two circles would amount to. "sina muteLI lukin" if Iunderstand it at all, which I apparently don't since I can't figure out whatyour two flat circlesare that we are supposed to see (or the two circles on your skin?).
