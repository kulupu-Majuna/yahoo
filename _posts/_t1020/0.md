Do you think it can be the international language? Do you think it canreally express everything by using it's root words. I believe so sincethe Chinese can do it and Toki Pona is very similar to it but what doyou believe? Do you think Toki Pona should only be written with the 14letters and the period or should it be written with colons (:),explanation marks (!), question marks (?), etc...?Do you think Toki Pona has a future and if so, what future? Will itreplace the European-centric Esperanto?
