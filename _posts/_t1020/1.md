> Do you think Toki Pona has a future and if so, what future?Yes, I think Toki Pona will probably gain enthusiasts, especially ifthere is a book available.I think it will always be what it was invented to be; a tool forexploration of meaning and for dispelling unnecessary complexity. Iwould like to see it used as an international \*contact\* language,perhaps as a "pidgin", because it can be learned in a ridiculouslyshort time and can be used to communicate simple but important things.jan Wiko
