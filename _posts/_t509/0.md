tenpo suno ni la mi pana e toki awen sin tawa jan pi kulupu mani Yahoo.I am trying to find the owner of [tokipona@yahoogroups.com](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.com). I sent email [totokipona-owner@yahoogroups.com](mailto://totokipona-owner@yahoogroups.com) a week ago and have had no response.If the owner is no longer moderating the group, please assign one or moreof the active non-spammer posters to be moderators or the new owner.We complained to the tokipona-owner address a week ago about the usercalling herself "Lora Smith" who's been posting a lot of spam to the group,and no action has been taken.--
