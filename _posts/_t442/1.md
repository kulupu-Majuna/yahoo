my suggestion is to try to take logographs which can be found in currentUnicode.I've just found some symbols...suno â˜¼ (sun)meli â™€ (female)mije â™‚ (male)musi â˜º (smiley) or â™ª (mus. note)moni Â¤ (currency symbol)tomo âŒ‚ (house)moli âœ (cross, but it is rather christian oriented)telo ~ (wave, tilde)Tomas
