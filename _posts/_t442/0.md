I think it'd be really fun to have a set of icons for each of the words in TokiPona. I've beenworking on this for quite some time, but the problem is, I'm not very artistic. :)Some of the symbols would be obvious--
a fish for "kala," a heart for "olin,"etc.--
but whatwould be, for instance, "wile"?Also, each glyph could have a second meaning..."waso" could be the sound "wa"and "wile"could be the sound "wi"...so to write my name (jan Wawi), you would write/draw(jan)\[(waso)(wile)\]...think hieroglypics here! :)Here are some I've worked out so far:olin heartjan a stick-figure personmusi a smileyjaki a frowniepona a check markkule a paintbrushsuno a sunNow, some of the more complicated would be "ideographs"...for instance:kule + suno = jelo (so you could have a small paintbrush on a sun...but thiswould beone glyph so as to distinguish it from simply "kule suno")...Suggestions? Feedback? musi ala musi anu seme?
