I think it'd be really fun to have a set of icons for each of the words in Toki Pona.  I've been working on this for quite some time, but the problem is, I'm not very artistic.  :)Some of the symbols would be obvious--
a fish for "kala," a heart for "olin," etc.--
but what would be, for instance, "wile"?Also, each glyph could have a second meaning..."waso" could be the sound "wa" and "wile" could be the sound "wi"...so to write my name (jan Wawi), you would write/draw (jan)\[(waso)(wile)\]...think hieroglypics here!  :)Here are some I've worked out so far:olin heartjan a stick-figure personmusi  a smileyjaki a frowniepona  a check markkule  a paintbrushsuno  a sunNow, some of the more complicated would be "ideographs"...for instance:kule + suno = jelo   (so youcould have a small paintbrush on a sun...but this would be one glyph so as to distinguish it from simply "kule suno")...Suggestions?  Feedback?  musi ala musi anu seme?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
