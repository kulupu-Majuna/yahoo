I'm glad that new Toki Pona texts are being written. I see some mistakes, but everything will be okay. Today I wrote a rhyming poem:)--
kili lili, tan Â jan Pije--
mi jo e kili.ona li pona li lili.mi moku e kili lili.--
The Little Fruit, by Pije.--
I have a fruit.It's good and small.I'm going to eat the little fruit.On the issue of the "Uluka" word, you said that you liked "Uluka" because it is "pona kute"... I would go for something more nasty, since Orcs are intended to be dirty and foul in the first place. I would think their name would be representative of their filth. Perhaps "Uluku" would be better. The choice is really up to you.And now some random rantings of woe, with no translation:mi pilin ike. ale li sama. mi pilin e ni: tenpo ala la ijo li kama ante. nasin ale li ike. pimeja li lon lawa mi. mi ken ala jo e meli pona. mama mi li olin ala e mama ante. mi wile tawa ma sin. mi wile ala lon ni. mi wile pana e telo oko. mi kin wile tawa. jan sewi o kute e toki mi! mi wile tawa!
