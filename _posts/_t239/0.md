I've been thinking about making a TP version of the story "The ThreeLittle Pigs".The only difficult part of the translation I can foresee is thedescription of each house, but Lament and I have already come up withthe following phrases:Brick house. tomo kiwen.Stick house. tomo pi kasi palisa.Straw house. tomo pi lipu kasi.I talked with Russ about making some illustrations to go along withthe story, and he seems to like the idea. He is even thinking wecould possibly add it to the Esperanto "Vola Pug" publication.I'm writing this email to see if anyone has any comments orsuggestions.Pije
