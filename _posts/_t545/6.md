> "God" is "jan sewi"(Oh, I forgot to comment on that in my previous post..)So God is this bored old man sitting up in the sky watching his children all the time 'cause he's got nothing better to do...I mean, really, many schools of thought, philosophers, religious leaders, have been trying to define what God is. I don't think many of them would stick to the concept of "jan sewi". Some would prefer "creator", others "the unified force", "the law of nature" etc.I think the most neutral definition would be "the upper force" or "wawa sewi".A lot of people prefer the more personal God.stevo
