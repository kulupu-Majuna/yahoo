No doubt it's the weirdest language I've ever encountered... but it's pretty cool indeed.Now I have some questions for you to help me make up my mind about the language:1. What is the Toki Pona for:- hatred- question- book- almost- without- God- Thank you!- You're welcome!2. What does the phrase "toki awen" mean?3. A little personal question: What does Toki Pona mean to you? Do you see it as a philosophy of life, linguistic parody, just a language you use for fun etc.?
