Hi!I've just finished the online Toki Pona course. No doubt it's theweirdest language I've ever encountered... but it's pretty coolindeed.Now I have some questions for you to help me make up my mind aboutthe language:1. What is the Toki Pona for:- hatred- question- book- almost- without- God- Thank you!- You're welcome!2. What does the phrase "toki awen" mean?3. A little personal question: What does Toki Pona mean to you? Doyousee it as a philosophy of life, linguistic parody, just a languageyouuse for fun etc.?Thanks
