Thank you too for the answers.
> "God" is "jan sewi"(Oh, I forgot to comment on that in my previous post..)So God is this bored old man sitting up in the sky watching hischildren all the time 'cause he's got nothing better to do...I mean, really, many schools of thought, philosophers, religiousleaders, have been trying to define what God is. I don't think manyof them would stick to the concept of "jan sewi". Some wouldprefer "creator", others "the unified force", "the law of nature"etc.I think the most neutral definition would be "the upper force"or "wawa sewi".
