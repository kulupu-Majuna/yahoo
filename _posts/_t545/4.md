Hi. Just some answers to questions I think I am able to reply.
> 1. What is the Toki Pona for:
> - hatredIsn't that too un-nice for toki pona? ;)It's enough to say this, I think:"ona li pona ala tawa mi"("It is not good for me.")
> - questiontoki seme (???)Maybe - though this may mean "which language" as well.Or (my invention):toki pi wile kama sona
> - booklipu toki
> - almostex.: "I almost got blind."ken la ni li kama: mi kama jan pi lukin alaMaybe not the best one, though, since it means "It may have happened.".Maybe you could make it stronger ("almost happened") by "ken mute" (???)
> - withoutex.: "I am without my girlfriend today.""tenpo suno ni la meli mi li lon ala poka mi."
> - Godjan sewi
> - Thank you!pona(or more complicated:)mi pana e pona tawa sina.
> - You're welcome!ale li pona. (???)It means "all is well", "dont' worry". So maybe this one?
> 2. What does the phrase "toki awen" mean?toki awen = text ("fixed, unmoving, captured speech")We are in the process of planning a dictionary which would cover notjust the basic words, but also groups of words with a fixed or suggestedmeaning. In the meantime, I find the following one also a good source:[http://rowa.giso.de/languages/toki-pona/english/dictionary.phpSome](http://rowa.giso.de/languages/toki-pona/english/dictionary.phpSome) basic phrases are also available on [http://www.tokipona.org](http://www.tokipona.org).
> 3. A little personal question: What does Toki Pona mean to you? Do
> you
> see it as a philosophy of life, linguistic parody, just a language
> you
> use for fun etc.?I presently see it as a wonderful language which is capable to expressalmost everything with a very small vocabulary and with a stilltolerable precision. Of course that for science etc. there is Esperanto,but it would be just nice to explore how a language like this coulddevelop, so I'm for pushing it forward and exploring all its aspects.The meeting of a bunch of tokiponists at the IJK (World Esperanto YouthConvention) in Sarajevo was a very exciting experience - it made a lotof us think of the time back in 1905 when speakers of Esperanto gatheredfor the first time to try the language in practice in speech.Marek (jan Male)
