Fellow Tokiponians,Thanks to Pije and Lament, we have added the much needed "kan"and "anu" back into the dictionary.There is only one problem. Namely, tokipona.org is down due to lackof funds. Domain names cost money, and I have been off work for sometime due to illness (and therefore cannot afford it alone).Could this mean the death of our little language?Some people have asked me how they could contribute in reobtainingour beloved domain name.If you like Toki Pona and wish to donate:1. Visit [http://www.paypal.com2](http://www.paypal.com2). Click on "sign up" if necessary3. Click on "send money"4. Donate whatever amount you can or want to [sonja@kisa.caI](mailto://sonja@kisa.caI) appreciate your support! On my part, I can secure our domain namefor as long as possible and get the website back up and running ASAP.Donors will have their name published in the pona hall of donors onthe new website.I have also been working on some long-awaited new lessons to replacethe old ones that were on the site, as well as some usefulexplanatory notes on such words as: la, o, kin, en, kama, sama, etc.Hopefully, I will have fun new content to publish in January if wecan get our site back.Happy holidays to everyone!Sonja/MarraskuuCreator of Toki Pona
