Donate whatever amount you can or want to sonja@k...To give an idea of how much money it will take:A .org domain costs 12 EUR a year ([http://www.gandi.net/](http://www.gandi.net/)), andhosting costs 35.40 USD a year ([http://www.virtualcobalts.com/](http://www.virtualcobalts.com/))for 50 MB of disk and 10 GB/mo of data transfer.That equals a little under 80 CAD.I'd be willing to up to 20 MB of the site on [http://www.pineight.comuntil](http://www.pineight.comuntil) the official site comes back up; I have plenty of sparebandwidth.--
