Hello,  
  
I've only been looking at this language for a couple of days. As I'm  
completely new to this (or any languages other than English) and  
haven't had a chance yet to look back over the postings in this group,  
please forgive me if this has been discussed before.  
  
Are there any intentions to expand the official dictionary? I can't  
see how you could distinguish between cats and dogs (or, indeed, other  
animals)?  
  
Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to represent autumn and spring.  
  
Lastly, has anyone put any audio samples together to aid in  
pronunciation? I think I've got it, although there appears to be some  
ambiguity in the vowel "a"; even Sonja in her Canadian radio interview  
seems to pronounce it differently in different words ("jan" and  
"pona"). I've gone for the "ahh" sound as I would pronounce "father"  
in England or Australia. Perhaps it is different in, for example, the  
US (cf: "rather").
