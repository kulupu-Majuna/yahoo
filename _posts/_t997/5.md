>Can I conclude that you all expect me doing this alone? ;)Anyway, except for a little part at the end of chapter 1 the stuff isdemo-complete, so I recommend you to test out already. You can do thatfor example with the demo at [http://tr.im/world_of_goo_esperante](http://tr.im/world_of_goo_esperante) (inproperties/config.txt change eo to tp).When anything is ready, I will prepare a demo-package just for tokipona. And maybe the toki pona version will be included in the boxedversion/updates to it. (Just maybe, but anyway you can play it, astold about before ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile"))Questions? Remarks? Very welcome! ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\--
