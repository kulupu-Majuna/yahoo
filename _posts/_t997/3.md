I don't think "esun" should be used to mean an "espace" or "world".We already have several words for different kinds of places: "ma","tomo" and "lon".I thought that "esun" was supposed to mean a place where things are\*bought\* or \*sold\*. Maybe as a verb it would mean "to shop", "to buy"or "to sell".I'd like to see examples from Sonja for how "esun" would be used.On Mon, Nov 24, 2008 at 05:31, AJK <[ikojba@gmail.com](mailto://ikojba@gmail.com)\
