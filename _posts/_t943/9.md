>> Another example is provided by Guugu Timithirr language speakers ofthe Cape York Peninsula in northeastern Australia. This group ofAborigines do not have words for left, right, front, or back. Theyuse absolute rather than relative directions. When they refer topeople or objects in their environment, they use compass directions.They would say "I am standing southwest of my sister" rather than "Iam standing to the left of my sister." Critics of the Sapir-Whorfhypothesis would point out that the Aborigines who speak this languagealso usually learn English and can use left, right, front, and backjust as we do. However, if they do not learn English during earlychildhood, they have difficulty in orienting themselves relatively andabsolute orientation makes much more sense to them.
