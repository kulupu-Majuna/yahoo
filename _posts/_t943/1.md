where is the language without 'left' and 'right' in this thirty-page rant?Sorry, I should have excerpted it, too.It's between the color test ("What color is this woman's blouse?") and the Ethnoscience section.[http://anthro.palomar.edu/language/language_5.htmAnother](http://anthro.palomar.edu/language/language_5.htmAnother) example is provided by Guugu Timithirr language speakers of the Cape York Peninsula in northeastern Australia.  This group of Aborigines do not have words for left, right, front, or back.  They use absolute rather than relative directions.  When they refer to people or objects in their environment, they use compass directions.  They would say "I am standing southwest of my sister" rather than "I am standing to the left of my sister."  Critics of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis would point out that the Aborigines who speak this language also usually learn English and can use left, right, front, and back just as we do.  However, if they do not learn English during early childhood, they have difficulty in orienting themselves relatively and absolute orientation makes much more sense to them.stevo
