I tend to take this as just one of the peculiarities of the language (they all --
 even Lojban --
have them). but I agree that one does expect at least "ona" to follow the pattern for "personalpronouns" --
 except that note "mi mute" does require "li."I understand that the rule applies only to the words "mi" and "sina", and not to first and second person subjects.  Since "mi mute" is not "mi", nor is it a bare pronoun \[it's a pronoun and an adjective\], it takes "li".  stevo
