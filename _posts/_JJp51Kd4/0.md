Since the Google interface can already be set to work in almost all of the  
languages you can imagine, including Klingon, l33t and Elmer Fudd, I thought  
they could add Toki Pona to the list so I emailed them.  
  
Here is their answer:  
  
Thank you for your interest in the Google in Your Language program. At  
this time, we're unable to support more languages. However, we appreciate  
your suggestion, and we'll consider adding Toki Pona to this program in  
the future.  
  
Regards,  
The Google Team
