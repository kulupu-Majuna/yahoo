Why not use tokipona.net?  
  
http://tokipona.net/tokipona/  
  
It is a custom search engine, which restricts your results to toki  
pona related pages.  
  
After searching, if you didn't find what you wanted in the  
tokiponasphere, there is a radio button to search the entire web.  
  
Personally, I think google chose L33t and Fudd as jokes. Toki pona  
obviously is a serious language, not deserving of being the butt of a  
geeky user interface joke.
