I know 118 words.Mi sona 118 nimi.If I knew reduplication, I would know 236 words.Mi kepeken nimi kepeken nimi tu la mi ken sona e nimi 236.I have search the web and found almost no one uses reduplication, except"mute, mute". It would be handy if reduplication meant something. Itwouldn't be very useful to make plural words, since we already have mute,e.g. "kala mute" Right now, it looks to me, with the strictest reading ofthe description of the language, I guess reduplication could only be usedfor phrases like, "mun mun", a lunar moon, or other similar redundantphrases that don't communicate any more than saying the word once would.Some language use the reduplication to mean a verb happens repeated \*mokumoku (to eat one self silly), that a noun is genuine (\*olin olin-true love),and some language don't follow the common pattern of intensification, butrepeated adjectives diminish the strength (\*sona sona-kind of smart) etc.jan Matthew pi kulupu mama Martin
