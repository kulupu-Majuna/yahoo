> A web page is not a thin flat bendable thing.I think that idiom is so widely accepted, and so natural, that it isthe simpler choice for TP. I think it is more a logical metaphor thanan idiom.Neverthess soon there will be flat bendable screens (with e-inktechnology), very similar to paper... In some sense, such a devicewill be a "lipu" too. But the name you use for "web page" does notdepend on the device you use to read it. A "web page" is notmaterial, so the metaphor has sense.Any way, perhaps there could be alternatives.jan mako--
