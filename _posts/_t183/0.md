"The Assoziations-Blaster is an interactive text network. Anyone,including you, is allowed to contribute to the text database. Andall the texts inside this database are connected automatically inreal time.You can not browse through all the texts in a linear way. Insteadyou jump from one text to another depending on their connections,revealing new meanings and associations.The information in the database is organized through keywords. Everytext belongs to a keyword, and the keywords create the connectionsbetween the texts. You are also allowed to create new keywords aftercertain intervals. So with your contribution you can help to buildup a non-linear map of all things that exist"o jan mute: fill in keywords in toki pona and teach toki pona by afew examples.
