> Cute, but I don't see any advantage to it as a regular thing. tp already has a number ofcausative constructions. Aha! It does allow the distinction between "I closed the door" and "Idid not open the door," both of which might be thought of as "mi open ala e lupa" (screed aboutlack of dsitinctive word negation here). The closing might better be "mi kama pi open ala e lupa"(the other version of not opening would be "mi kama open ala e lupa"). I suppose that thelocutions you suggest could be used as available alternatives (though I am not sure that takingtheabsolutive as "because of" or "tan" is entirely justified).
