I had a thought.Some languages treat the subjects of intranitive verbs and theobjects of transitive verbs the same, while making the subjects oftransitive verbs a separate case. These are called "ergative-absolutive languages," or just "ergative" for short. I talked withsomeone who was learning such a language, and he said, "I think of itas being 'because of;' instead of 'you teach me,' it's 'because ofyou, I learn.'"I imagine we could do this in Toki Pona using "tan." Why would we dothis? Well, we could say a lot of things that are otherwisedifficult to say.mi open e lupa tomo. --

> tan mi, lupa tomo li open. I opened thedoor.Not very different, but with this construction, we could talk aboutclosing a door:tan mi, lupa tomo li open ala. I closed the door.tan mi ala, lupa tomo li open ala. I didn't close the door (butsomeone did).Then we could construct the causative:tan sina, mi open e lupa tomo. You made me open the door.There's a lot we could do without adding any new words or grammar,just by using "tan." What do you all think?jan Sosuwa
