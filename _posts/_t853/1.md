>Cute, but I don't see any advantage to it as a regular thing. tp already has anumber ofcausative constructions. Aha! It does allow the distinction between "I closedthe door" and "Idid not open the door," both of which might be thought of as "mi open ala elupa" (screed aboutlack of dsitinctive word negation here). The closing might better be "mi kamapi open ala e lupa"(the other version of not opening would be "mi kama open ala e lupa"). Isuppose that thelocutions you suggest could be used as available alternatives (though I am notsure that takingthe absolutive as "because of" or "tan" is entirely justified).
