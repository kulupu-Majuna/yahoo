toki,  some more comments: 
> ilo nasa drugsken la, "ijo nasa" li pona (for it includes natural and chemical drugs taken as pills, powder,smoke, injection, etc. For me, a coca leaf is not ijo but kasi, or a drug pill is more a "mokusike nasa" than "ilo nasa".   
> kulupu lipu file (computer)I'd look at this as being e.g. an MSWord file comprising several pages   
> pilin ala sense, concept, meaning Is "pilin ale" meant? 
> awen tawa keep on going To me, "tawa awen" seems more logical ("to walk permanently"), while I understand "awen tawa" as "to stop walking".   
> poka e attach, connect add to is complement? Or tawa? or lon?"poka e X lon Y" li pona tawa mi.   
> soweli kiwen automobile or train As soweli means also "meat" besides "mammal", Iread soweli kiwen as "salami" or "armadillo" or "statue of a mammal". If soweli kiwen were taken as "car" or "train", we might also say "waso kiwen" when talking about airplanes, or "kala kiwen" to mean a submarine.   I am not very happy about using number expressions such as "namba tu wan" without a preceding pi because this would be an exception from the general use of pi. IMHO, a conlang should avoid exceptions from rules as far as possible.   o pona! jan Elumutu       John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\
