>> he ((is visually) in the sense of equalness/sameness) in the senseof bug.So you claim that "lukin" can mean "is visually". Well, maybe it can,but that's not what the word lists say:lukin vt see, look at, watch, read vi look, watch out, pay attention mod visual(ly) \[looking\]lukin vtr vidi, rigardi, spekti, observi, legi vntr rigardi, atenti a vida, videThe Esperanto version is particularly unambiguous; there's no"aspekti" in there.Perhaps the official word lists are out of date. I'm happy with that.I just want to understand what's going on.
