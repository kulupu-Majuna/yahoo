I've been looking through the lessons athttp://[http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/lesson/lesson0.htmlThey](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/lesson/lesson0.htmlThey) seem good to me. I have a little list of comments, which I'llsend later, but there's one thing in lesson 7 that I'll mentionimmediately because I find it particularly worrying.The lesson has these examples:ona li lukin sama pipi. --
 He looks like a bug.jan li lukin sama pipi. --
 People look like ants.However, in lesson 4 "lukin" was explained as "to see, to look at;vision, sight". So, do these sentences mean "He has vision like a bug"and "People have similar eyesight to ants", or is "lukin" ambiguous,rather like English "look", despite the explanation in lesson 4?For saying that people have a similar appearance to ants, I would haveexpected, by analogy with "pona lukin", something with "sama lukin",perhaps "jan li sama lukin sama pipi". However, "sama" seems to behavelike "lon" and "tawa": it's a preposition or a verb used without "e",so the analogy with "pona" is a bit dodgy.Can anyone advise?
