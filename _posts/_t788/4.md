>> "jan sewi li lon mi" you mean? I don't understand.
>I meant that what you want is the whole "God exists" is what is to/for me ormaybe just "existsfor me" ("lon tawa mi" as Head Mod v. Pred Prep) is a predicate of God, which iswhat thestructure suggests. "lon mi" looks like "chez moi", "at me" and doesn't havemuch dative sense, Ithink. I do like the parallelisms, but it is undercut somewhat by the fact thatthe firstsentence doesn't quite work and the last is not very clear. Having said allthat, I don't have anysuggestions for fixing it and I do like the way it flows.
