Milddissonance: "X li ponatawa mi" usually means "I like X" (probably underlyingly "X \*seems\* good to me")but here the"good to" (or "good for") is more "literal." I don't know how to make thedistinction, since itis not entirely about my feeling here: I may like them, but they are reallydoing good thingsto/for me.The believe piece is hard; literally I sup\[pose it has to be "mi pilin e ni: jansewi li lon." Ofcourse you intend the "tawa mi" to work ;like the usual "pona tawa mi" but,outside the idiom, itmay work more directly, modifyin just "lon" and giving God's purpose or goal orproprietor.Nitpicking aside, this is very nice.
