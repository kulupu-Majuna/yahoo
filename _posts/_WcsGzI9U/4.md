Not \*the\* international language, but I think it can be \*an\*  
international language. I wouldn't be surprised if it grew to the  
point where every major city had maybe fifty people or so who spoke it  
and wouldn't mind spending some time with travelers. It would be much  
easier to have a simple conversation in Toki Pona amongst people who  
do not share a language than it would be to stumble through each  
other's languages. But it wouldn't be possible to talk about  
everything at every level of detail.

I think it suffices for many of the things we talk about the most. At  
a coarse resolution it seems to do fine. But it's a bit like thinking  
with boxing gloves on. Not hard to get a point across, but hard to fix  
a watch with. I'm hoping to get my girlfriend and my friends to learn  
it so we can have private conversations in public situations.

I'm also learning Lojban right now and they're really quite anal about  
orthographic concerns. TP's inner circle doesn't seem to have made  
anything like a ruling about this. It ought to be possible to write it  
with many or most of the world's orthographies. I agree with jan  
Elumutu regarding punctuation. More would seem to be extraneous. At  
the same time, the philosophy seems to be live and let live and it  
doesn't seem worthwhile to make a big deal out of it.

I think it has many futures.  
  
1\. For curious people or philosophers who want to expand their minds  
2\. For researchers exploring aspects of language  
3\. As an extremely simple international auxiliary language (as jan  
Wiko says)  
4\. For depressed people who want to try outlandish remedies  
5\. For people who want to have private conversations in public  
6\. For language constructors doing research before making their own  
  
Probably another dozen others I haven't thought of.

I don't even think it's a serious contender for that. A bit like  
asking if bicycles stand a chance of replacing subway systems.  
  
Lojban is a more likely candidate for replacing Esperanto, but the  
odds of that are extremely small.
