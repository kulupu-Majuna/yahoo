At present, colon and full-stop are used in toki pona. I think that commas, semicolons (;) or dashes are quite unnecessary in the light of tp's simple syntactic structure. Whoever wants to use ? and ! may do so 8-))  
I believe that tp has to "ripen" more before becoming an international language, and I am sure that despite all previous discussions about "right and left" or large numbers or "pi" chains, etc.  
But I remain optimistic!

Do you think it can be the international language? Do you think it can  
really express everything by using it's root words. I believe so since  
the Chinese can do it and Toki Pona is very similar to it but what do  
you believe? Do you think Toki Pona should only be written with the 14  
letters and the period or should it be written with colons (:),  
explanation marks (!), question marks (?), etc...?  
  
Do you think Toki Pona has a future and if so, what future? Will it  
replace the European-centric Esperanto?
