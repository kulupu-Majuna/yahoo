No. Toki Pona is not at all suitable for use as a general-purpose language.  
  
Complex or detailed topics can't be discussed in a language which has  
no dependent clauses and which has no way to express mathematics.  
Esperanto, on the other hand, is a fully capable language which can be  
used just as well and for the same things as any national language.  
The thing which makes Esperanto such a good International Auxiliary  
Language ("IAL") is that its planned regularity makes it so much  
easier to learn than any ad-hoc national language.

Yes, I think Toki Pona will probably gain enthusiasts, especially if  
there is a book available.  
  
I think it will always be what it was invented to be; a tool for  
exploration of meaning and for dispelling unnecessary complexity. I  
would like to see it used as an international \*contact\* language,  
perhaps as a "pidgin", because it can be learned in a ridiculously  
short time and can be used to communicate simple but important things.
