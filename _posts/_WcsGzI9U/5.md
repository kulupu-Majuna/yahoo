> From a face-value look at it (I don't know any Toki Pona), I'd say that there are some really beneficial things about Toki Pona that are much better than Esperanto, like the small about of sounds and lack of annoying consonant clusters. But when it comes to IAL's, I believe that the most successful one will probably itself be a naturally born pidgin of the most popular or well known languages, e.g. elements from English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic etc etc. Actually, there's probably already an international language out there, we're just yet to put the pieces together ;)
