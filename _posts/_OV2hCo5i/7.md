The word "pi" requires the listener to hold the beginning of the  
phrase in memory until the sub-phrase following "pi" is interpreted.  
If we allow "pi" to create sub-sub phrases, then teh listener is  
required to keep another concept in memory for every "pi". That's  
added complexity. "ike".  
  
I think the simplest solution is to say that "pi" also \*closes\* the  
interpretation of the preceding part of the phrase (including any  
prior "pi"-sequence). Consider "pi" as a \*separator\*. This way, no  
matter how many "pi"-sequences are strung together only \*one\* thing  
must be held in memory at a time.  
  
So "A pi B C pi D E" would be "(A pi B C) pi D E".
