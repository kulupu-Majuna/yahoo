<< The original English phrase is ambiguous, and so is the first tp phrase. In the second phrase, you have added a "lili" which means that the school as well as the girls are little which is more than what the English phrase says. As I'm not a native speaker of English, I'm not sure whether a school can be "pretty" at all but I feel it cannot. Therefore, I would split the phrase up and say something about "tomo sona" in a first sentence and then ". meli lili pi pona lukin li tawa tomo sona ni."  
Generally, I prefer to avoid multiple pi phrases in one sentence. If they cannot be avoided, I think that (A pi BC) pi D li ... is correct, as a sequence of single-word attributes also always refers to A.
