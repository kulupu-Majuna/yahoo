If we interpret it the other way, then how would you say  
"(A pi B C) pi D E"?  
  
Syntactically both options have the same advantage and disadvantage  
but in opposite directions. If you treat it one way, you won't be  
able to interpret it the other way.  
  
Semantically though, treating "pi" as a sub-modifier requires more  
complexity and a back-and-forth sort of motion to interpret. Treating  
"pi" as a separator is straightforward and doesn't require  
backtracking.  
  
If you think you need more than one "pi" in a phrase, you probably  
should break it up anyway.
