I think I see the problem with multiple pi's in a sentence now.  
  
So in the example I gave, would I treat it like any other relative clause?  
  
In other words, if I wanted to say, for example, "The pretty little  
girls' school is where Susan went to school," I would say, "tomo sona  
pi meli lili li lukin pona \[if I choose that particular  
interpretation\]. tenpo pini la, jan Susan li tawa tomo ni." Is this  
correct?
