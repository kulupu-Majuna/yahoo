Schools can be pretty, although they aren't usually described that way.  
This is a classic sentence for ambiguity, and one of the worst, because  
"pretty" is polysemous, meaning either "pleasant to look at" or just "rather,  
very". In fact, "pretty pretty" can be used, but since it sounds silly, it's not  
used much.
