I disagree. Once "pi" has been used, all following modifiers refer to the  
pi-phrase. The modifiers can't 'leapfrog' over the pi-phrase to modify the  
words before "pi".  
So while A pi B C is good, A pi B C pi D is not, because 1) at least two  
words have to follow "pi" and 2) D modifies B C instead of the whole A pi B C.  
The single-word attributes don't always modify A.  
  
To add D to A pi B C, you can say A D pi B C or A pi B C D, which don't  
really mean the same thing, or rephrase it as A pi B C li D.
