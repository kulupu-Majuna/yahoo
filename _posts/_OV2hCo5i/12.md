I guess we would use noun classes, like the Bantu languages.  
  
The following sentence is ambiguous in Toki Pona, just like in English:  
  
waso li moku e kili. ona li suli.  
A bird ate a fruit. It was big.  
  
This sentence could be disambiguated like this:  
  
1) waso li moku e kili. waso ni li suli.  
2) waso li moku e kili. kili ni li suli.  
  
If they're the same noun class, I guess you wouldn't use a pronoun.  
Instead of:  
  
"jan Alisa li sona e jan Sawa. tenpo luka tu la, ona \[or "jan ni"\] li  
sike e suno."  
  
we would have:  
  
"jan Alisa li sona e jan Sawa. tenpo luka tu la, jan Sawa li sike e  
suno."  
  
Unless someone has a better way...
