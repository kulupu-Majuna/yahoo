lipu sina li suwi lukin. although i have a hard time trying to readthe site, you use a compleatly diffrent style of toki pona , iguess, then anything ive ever read before. although i guess it lookslike you use it correctly, lol, but i just have trouble knowingcertain words your compiling and what they may mean, have you lookedat the dictionary that puts words togeather? it may make it a littleeasier to interpret what you are saying if you used the combonationsthat are commonly used.
