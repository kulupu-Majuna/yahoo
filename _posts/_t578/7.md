Even after researcher DanielEverett tried to teach them, they couldn't even count to ten. So your"little big numbers" are not "crucial" for a language itself.You should ask yourself what it is that you want TP to be widely used\*for\*. Do you want it to be popular asYet-Another-Constructed-Language? I don't. I would rather see morepeople try the experiment of changing the way they think, to see ifthey can fit their thoughts into Toki Pona's simplicity. I think it'shugely useful to have a gauge on the complexity level of my thoughts.

They don't mean whatyou want them to under the current grammar, and they run contrary tothe obvious and stated intent behind Toki Pona, that it be a simplelanguage to see whether people can think simply by using it.Toki Pona is an experiment along the lines of the Sapir-Whorfhypothesis. Can a person learn to think in a more simple way just bylearning a language that restricts complexity? In your case, I thinkthe experiment has returned a negative result.jan Wiko
