I agree with jan Pita. My main objection to the numbering scheme wasthat it was turning "la" into a homonym for two different meanings.That's why I don't like using "luka" as "five" either, because ittakes on a totally different meaning after "nanpa". I don't even likelinking "tu wan" to get three because gramatically that would onlymean "one pair". The only numbers I like in TP are: ala wan tu mute alijan Wiko
