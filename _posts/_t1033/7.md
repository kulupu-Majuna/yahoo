a a a! ni li musi mute!This got me wondering how easily tp could develop a culture around itsusage/history. Could the word Kijetesantakalu come into the language (as aname/borrowed word attribute) to refer to this incident.e.g. musi Kijetesantakalu = a practical joke (like this one), janKijetesantakalu = a practical joker, tenpo suno Kijetesantakalu = a day forpractical jokes like April fool's day etc.are there any examples of such things happening in tokipona. (This would forexample be analogous to "krokodili" in esperanto which, if i am not mistaken,refers to a crocodile in the Cseh-language course who would not speakesperanto.)jan Sowelilili---
