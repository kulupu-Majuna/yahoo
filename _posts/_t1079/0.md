I have attempted to translate Eliazar Parra Cardenas 'TP in 76 IllustratedLessons' from Spanish into English. You can download my translation at this URL:[https://aiki.pbworks.com/f/tp+in+76+lessons+English.pdfMy](https://aiki.pbworks.com/f/tp+in+76+lessons+English.pdfMy) Spanish is practically non-existant (I relied heavily on Google's translationtools, so there may be better translations in English) and I am just learningTP, so all comments and corrections are welcome. I tried to keep the Englishtranslation as close to Eliazar's original text as possible. If anyone has thetime or inclination, the following lessons in particular could stand a review:37 - pata43 - kan56, 57, 58 - seme71, 72 - laand 50 - numbers - I know luka has been deprecated, but I like to use it for 5as well.I was a bit lazy at the end and substituted a TP to English dictionary in theappendix, instead of translating the TP to Spanish dictionary. I hope this isok.Eliazar's original text is available at:[http://elzr.com/tokipona/I](http://elzr.com/tokipona/I) will add any corrections that I receive.Thanks,Dave
