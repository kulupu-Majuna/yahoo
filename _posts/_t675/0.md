Greetings,Some time ago I was quite busy translating Google and Gmail intoEsperanto. I also speak another cute, very fast growing conlang, madein 2000 by Sonja Elen Kisa: toki pona. It's a funlanguage, just likeKlingon it's not specially made to be spoken. However it's spoken yetby some hundred people and it's growing quite fast. Maybe I and somepeople from the toki pona community can begin to translate Google totoki pona?Sincerely,Joop Kiefte (LaPingvino / jan Mimoku)
