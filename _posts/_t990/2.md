jan ali o toki !mi wile pona e ni : ale li pona a !pilin pona tawa jan Mimoku tan ni : li toki e lon pi pali pina ona0 tawa ponaTo: [tokipona@yahoogroups.comFrom](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.comFrom): [ikojba@gmail.comDate](mailto://ikojba@gmail.comDate): Mon, 10 Nov 200817:39:39 +0100Subject: Re: \[tokipona\] explain trouble clearlyDear Sven,I'm sorry for this inconvenience. The settings are: "Firstmessagemoderated, then not any more" but Yahoo makes it harder than necesary...Nowyour messages are not moderated any more before posted. I'm terribly sorryittook me so long to switch the moderation off for you :'(. (It's a bithidden inthe member settings, so it's a les trivial task than I would likeit.)And yes,I'm responsible for the mere fact that the stuff is moderated thisway. Uponrequest of members because of spam (which I still have to pick outquite alot...) I became moderator and set up this policy. I even got ahelping moderator(Marek//jan Male) in case I'm not there, but the both ofus don't have loads oftime on hands.So, yet another time sorry, and I hope this solves it for now.janMimoku2008/11/10 Sven Walper <[Eingang@penzeng.de](mailto://Eingang@penzeng.de)\
