> Sorry, but I don't understand anything about the trouble betweenyou and "jan lawa pi TP"
> Could you explain it clearly on this forum, or somebody else coulddo it ?Sure, I can explain it:I have no personal quarrel with any of you. I'm just unhappy withthis platform (the Toki Pona Yahoo Group) because it seems cumbersomeand inconvenient to me.One big inconvenience is that any post has to be approved by anadministrator before it becomes visible to the group. This seemsinconvenience to me because I frequently write in several otherinternet forums, and none of them is run in such a restrictive mode.Usually, in any forum, posts are immediately published when sent. Butin this group, once a harmless little post of me was automaticallyrejected because noone approved it within 7 days. I suppose thishappend by an oversight, but it was pretty annoying to me.And there are further inconveniences here, too: You people are nice,but all in all this Yahoo Group user interface seems awkward to me. Iwish we'd all relocate to a modern style forum like "Simple MachinesForum" or something similar.
