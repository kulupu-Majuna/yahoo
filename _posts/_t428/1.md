Re: calques (and neologisms in general)nimi li lon ala la mi mute li pali e nimi sin. nimi sin li sona alatawa jan ale la mi mute li kama sona e sona ona tawa jan ale.I'm reasoning by how people use acronyms in written text. The firstusage is defined, then used "idiomatically" thereafter. The need tobe able to coin idioms is especially necessary for abstractions. Ican coin a phrase for lion by picking out a few salient features andusing them to modify soweli, but phrases like the following are muchharder to coin a phrase.lie, v mi ken ala \[lie?\] tawa sina.honor, noun, mi jo e \[honor?\]beauty, noun, mi pali tawa \[beauty?\] I work for beauty/to createbeatiful things.abstract, adj, verb. nanpa sona li sona \[abstract?\]. nanpa sona li\[abstracts\] tan lon. Math is abstract. It abstracts from reality.fast/slow. mi pali \[slow?\]. mi lukin \[fast?\] e lipu nimi.jan ale li sona ala sona e nimi pona tawa ni mute?Also, on the topic of coining phrases in toki pona, some words seemlike they'd be easier to translate if we could embed verbs into nounphrase, E.g. cheetah.soweli Cheetah li tawa kepeken noka tu tu li mu wawa li tawa wawa.A cheetah is an animal that goes on four legs, roars, runs powerfully.Three things the cheetah \*does\*soweli \[ ? \] li tawa wawa e mi? soweli pi tawa kepeken noka tu tu pi mu wawa pi tawa wawa li tawa wawa e miA cheetah is chasing me.It looses a lot turning the li's into pi's. All the modifiers tosoweli now feel static.mi tawa,jan Matthew MartinOn 10/2/07, John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\
