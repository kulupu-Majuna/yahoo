2\. Currently Toki Pona has a special rule for expressing numbers greater than 2.  For example, "tu wan" is 'three', "tu tu tu" is 'six', and so on.  The values of the individual number words are simply added together.  This is not consistent with the rest of Toki Pona grammar, in which the first (head) term is modified by following terms, not simply added to them.  jan Setepo / stevo
