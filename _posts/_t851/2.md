Is it just me or do other people see those words easily being used as verbs?nouns:akesi, ilo, kala, kasi, kili, ko, len, linja, lipu, luka, lupa,ma, mani, nanpa, nasin, nena, nimi, noka, oko, palisa, pipi, poki,selo, sijelo, sinpin, soweli, suno, supa, tenpo, waso Verbs:ilo: to tinkerko: to reduce to power / goolen: to clothelinja: to make into a line / ropelipu: to flattenluka: to slaplupa: to piercemani: to sellnanpa: to countnasin: to convertnena: to shape like a hillnimi: to namenoka: to take rootspalisa: to shape like a stickpoki: to fillselo: to envelopesuno: to light,supa: to make into a surfaceOr even modifiers (lizard-like, bird-like). If I talked about a soweli waso, I probably mean a winged mammal. I'm going to use Toki Pona in a live action roleplaying game and the quickest way to say "orc" in my humble opinion is jan ike akesi.Why can't certain words be used as whatever form makes sense? The distinction seems arbitrary to me...
