It seems some compound words are invalid because when not read ascompound words, they wouldn't form a grammatical phrase.Here is my attempt to chart that observation out. (This also meansthat there are far fewer than 470,000 compound words and they probablycould be mechanically listed, see end for new count)Two word compoundsCan be made from two other wordsn yes (telo nasa)mod yes (jelo lili)sep no ?vt yesvi yes (e.g. pilin ike, to feel sad)interj no ?prep no ?conj no ?kama yes (by definition)cont no ?oth ?To test my hypothesis, I'd need to find some toki pona words that areofficially only nouns, only verbs, and only modifiers, and try to makesome compound words out of them. e.g.nouns:akesi, ilo, kala, kasi, kili, ko, len, linja, lipu, luka, lupa,ma, mani, nanpa, nasin, nena, nimi, noka, oko, palisa, pipi, poki,selo, sijelo, sinpin, soweli, suno, supa, tenpo, wasoModifier: jelo, kin, laso, loje, seli, tasonouns two word compounds second word n mod vt/vi kaman ? N ? n/amod Y N ? n/avt/vi ? ? ? n/akama n/a n/a n/a n/anot sure: noun + noun: akesi ilo? kili pipi?invalid: noun + prep = e.g. "in group" doesn't mean "clique"modifier two word compounds second word n mod vt/vi kaman ? N N n/amod Y Y N n/avt/vi N N N n/akama n/a n/a n/a n/anot sure: noun + noun: if it was valid, would two nouns make an adjective?invalid: modifier + prep = e.g. "ingrown" Prepositions are extremelycommon morphemes in English. Think of all those words with latinprepositions embedded in them. Naive English speakers trying to writein Toki pona are going to get caught by this a lot.All official verbs can also server as some non-verb part of speach! Sothere isn't really a way to test the following:vt/vi two word compounds second word n mod vt/vi kaman N N N? n/amod N N Y? n/avt/vi ? Y? Y Y (?)kama n/a n/a Y Y?not sure: Couldn't I make any word pair into a verb by using "li"?invalid: verb + prep, e.g lukin "looking forward to", i.e. no Englishstyle phrasal verbsI won't attempt charts for 3 word compounds. If my observation iscorrect- that compound words must be internally grammatically correctphrases, then everything I wrote above could be probably be condensedinto the phrase structure rules for verb phrases and noun phrases.Does anyone know what doubling a word means? For example, orang orangis plural in Indonesian. I don't know what akesi akesi means. lililili makes sense, but I'm not sure what jelo jelo means--
does doublingmean intensification or is it just non-sense?If we have 94 nouns, 64 modifiers and 65 verbs and if compond wordsmust be grammatically correct phrases, then we have conservativelyspeaking:nouns: 94\* 64= 6016modifiers: 64\*64 + 94 \* 64=10,112verbs: 65\*64 = 4160For a grand total of about 20,288 compound wordsAnd as the toki pona tokiponomancy game shows, maybe half of thosemake sense of any sort or in any context.So toki pona can make about 10,000 compound words before you need toresort to longer phrases.Matthew Martin
