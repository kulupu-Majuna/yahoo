I'm curious about your motivation for the particular  
way you've reduced Toki Pona's phoneme inventory.  
It looks like you've dropped /s/, /u/, and /i/. If I were  
going to reduce TP's phoneme inventory even  
further, I would not drop the only fricative, but one  
of the phonemes in a category where TP has  
two or three already: /t/ or /m/ or /w/ perhaps.  
And for maximal contrast of a three-vowel system,  
I'd make the prototypical values /i a u/ rather than  
/e a o/.  
  
Your website doesn't as far as I can tell say anything  
about Bon Wen phonotactics; I infer from the word  
forms I see used that it's basically the same as  
Toki Pona's, right?  
  
The grammar isn't thoroughly described yet, but  
I like what I see so far and would like to see more  
of it eventually.
