But generally, when translatinga text of which you don't know the orginal language,it helps to compare multiple translations into languagesyou do know. I usually compare at least twotranslations when rendering some Bible passage intoa conlang. (If in the NT, I look at the original too,but I don't really know Greek well enough to relyon that alone.)It's probably also more accurate to describe the resultsas a "paraphrase" rather than a "translation" since you'renot working from the original, and leaving out a lot ofdetails even from the loose paraphase you'reworking from.- Jim Henryhttp://[http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/esp.htm](http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/esp.htm)
