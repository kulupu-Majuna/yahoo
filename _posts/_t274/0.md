Hey everyone,Just letting you know I've got a new translation up on my site. Ichose to use the Biblical account of Creation from a children'sBible (for easier translation and to fit with TP philosophy).Because I'm lazy and because my site badly needs visitors, I'm goingto give you the link instead of posting it here. Call it badnetiquette, but my site really needs some traffic. Sorry. :PAnyways, take a look and tell me what you think. You can use theforums on my site for discussing the translation, or use up spacehere. Whatever you prefer.[http://www.tokipona.bravehost.com/genesis1.html](http://www.tokipona.bravehost.com/genesis1.html) is the translationwww.tokipona.bravehost.com is the main pageThanks everyone,-jan Kowimi wile e ni: ali li pona.
