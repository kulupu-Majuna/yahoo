The problem is that it can also be after (modify) them all and there is no way to tell which ismeant except context (which is not likely to be very useful in this example).  Note that, inwritten form, the English is identically ambiguous.I see.  I thought the scope would only be the immediately applicable phrase, not the several preceding clauses.  Thusjan li pona li suli li wawa has three distinct predicates, and adding a modifier to one can't affect the others.I still think that, but others may think differently.So whereas the English is ambiguous because the adverb and modify the several preceding verbs, the Toki Pona is not ambiguous because there is only the one verb preceding the modifier.  The other verbs are separate predicates and each must have its own modifier, even if it's the same.This is the way I want Toki Pona to work.  It may not be the way it actually does work.jan Setepo / stevo
