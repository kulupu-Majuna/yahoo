> I wouldn't think so. The prefixed conditions are just that, conditions underwhich the assertionfollowing is true. "pona la" probably means something like"Happily," in its by-the-way sense. In so far as they modify anything, they modify the whole following sentence notjust the verb,say. But all of this needs some further discussion; thanks for raising theissue.
