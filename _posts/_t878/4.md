I wouldn't think so.  The prefixed conditions are just that, conditions under which the assertionfollowing is true.  "pona la" probably means something like "Happily," in its by-the-way sense.In so far as they modify anything, they modify the whole following sentence not just the verb,say.  But all of this needs some further discussion; thanks for raising the issue.No, officially the part before la is an adverbial phrase, so pona la in this case, according to me, is used right. This construction is perfect to use conditional or to describe a path in history (if this then that / first this, then that), but no one tells us we have to use it only this way. (See it as idiomatical use of grammar)Be glad we have more ways to express things. We will need them ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile").jan Mimoku
