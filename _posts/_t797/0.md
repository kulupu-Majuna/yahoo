> So soweli is modified by waso, not the other way round.Both are goods, I think, depending on where you want to "put thestress" \[is it a right expression in English?\]. Look at thedefinition of "waso":<< waso n bird, winged animal 
>>So "waso" not necessarily is a bird. "waso soweli" can be understoodas "a winged animal having properties of a (land) mammal". That'sfine too.In fact, also the meaning of "soweli" is very wide too:<< soweli n animal, especially land mammal, lovable animal 
>>That word, "especially", is interesting. Are there animals (not"waso", not "akesi", not "pipi", not "kala") that are not landmammals?And "lovable animal" is a bit subjective description. Can "soweli" bea lovable animal (for somebody), but not a land mammal? Anyway, a batdoesn't seem very lovable :-)The same "problem" arises about "pterodactyl": "waso akesi" or "akesiwaso". Both look good to me, depending on context.jan Mako--
