Maybe it is best to put the "anu" between two sentences: sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu \[sina/li\] wile tawa tomo moku. Besides, I think that nobody has ever seen a "foodish house-go" ![8-)](images/smilies/icon_cool.gif "Cool")) jan ElumutuRick Miller <[rdmiller3@gmail.com](mailto://rdmiller3@gmail.com)\

Even if you simplify, it won't fit into asingle Toki Pona sentence.Even your initial question had serious problems."sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu tawa tomo moku?" means"Do you want to see either a movie or(otherwise) (see) a foodish house-go.The skeleton sentence is "You want"."anu" separates predicate substantives. It does not allow you to havea secondverb. ooooooooside 2008-04-02 and 2008-04-08 between 2008-04-09 and 2008-04-15 <hr size=1
