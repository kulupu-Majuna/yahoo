Yes, it's somewhat longerbut not too complex or vague at all.
> As for the main idea of tp, we had discussions in the groupalready about whether it should be extreme simplicity (accepting thateven simple things like "crossroads, direction, between, etc." are toocomplex for tp) or the capability of expressing (nearly) everything intp. I'm clearly fond of the second option. Besides, I'd like tosuggest to classify tp words only as follows: structural particles (e,la, li, pi, taso, kin), pronouns (mi, sina, ona, ni), basic words(which can be used as subject, predicate, object, property,conjunction, modifier, specifier, etc. as necessary), and capitalizedunofficial words. In that case, one could say, e. g., "anu tu taso lilon" meaning "there are only two alternatives" (stressing "tu").
