Even if you simplify, it won't fit into asingle Toki Pona sentence.Even your initial question had serious problems."sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu tawa tomo moku?" means"Do you want to see either a movie or(otherwise) (see) a foodish house-go.The skeleton sentence is "You want"."anu" separates predicate substantives. It does not allow you to havea second verb.
