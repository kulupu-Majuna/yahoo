I was looking for a better word for "peace" in Toki Pona, rather than defining it in negative terms like "utala ala". I then realized that the motto of Toki Pona itself, "ale li pona", means "peace". When all is well around you, and you accept and love everything as "pona", you have peace.By the way, the website is down, and I am moving it to a new host. It will be up again (also with new content!) shortly.Sonja
