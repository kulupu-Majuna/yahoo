jan ali pi toki pona o, toki! Some time ago, the problem of using several "pi" constructions in one sentencewas discussed. Here are my suggestions for a possible solution:If two pi expressions refer to one basic word, they should be separated by "en"as in "jan pi kalama musi EN pi pona mute lukin" = a very attractive singer"(both pi phrases refer to jan). If the second pi phrase refers to the first piphrase, no "en" is necessary, as in "lon open pi tenpo sike pi nanpa tu la, janlili li open tawa" (at the beginning of his second year, the baby begins towalk). Here, the first pi phrase refers to "open" and the second to "tenposike". Whoever dislikes these constructions is of course free to split suchsentences up into two although this would increase the wordiness.mi wile sona e pilin pi sina mute.jan Elumutu\[Non-text portions of this message have been removed\]
