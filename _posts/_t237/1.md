I think the main law oftoki pona must be like that: if you can't describe the process in toki pona,it's more complicated then it should be. It's the key point of"philosofy behind the language" ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") Maybe, if other instruments aredifferent in their cultural or ritual meaning, other terms should beadded.
