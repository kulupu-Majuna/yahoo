toki! I'd appreciate it if a Toki Pona course for Esperanto speakersexisted, and that the very interesting web sitehttp://[http://www.tokipona.bravehost.com/](http://www.tokipona.bravehost.com/) were translated. I'm interested inthe Hangul writing system.If somebody translates it into Esperanto, I will be able to translateit into my native language, Spanish. There are many web sites inEnglish; however, I cannot learn using the English language.Cheers,--
