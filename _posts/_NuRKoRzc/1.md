sinpin anpa mi li suli. mi wile e ni: mi jo e sinpin anpa lili. mi moku e pan lili e kili mute. mi moku ala e suwi. mi moku e moku pona. mi pali e sijelo mi. mi sewi li anpa e ijo suli. ijo li jo e nimi Kettlebells. mi wile e ni: sijelo mi li kama wawa. pali musi sijelo kepeken ijo Kettlebells li pona tawa mi.  
\*The old problem of prepositional phrases in noun phrases: are theylegal? I would use 'pali musi sijelo ni' for the nonce, just in case.  
  
tenpo pini la mi ken pali musi sijelo tawa tenpo lili. tenpo ni la mi ken pali musi sijelo tawa tenpo suli. kin mi tawa noka lon nasin tawa tenpo suli.  
\*I s 'tawa tenpo' for 'for/during/over a time' quite right; my usual worry about too literal English renditions. Ie may be right and Lord know we need something for this.  
ante la pona mute.

My waist is large. I wish to have a small waist. I eat a little bread and much fruit. I don not eat sweets. I eat good food. I work my body. I lift and lower heavy objects. The objects have the name kettlebells. I wish this: my body becomes strong. I like to exercise using kettlebells. Before I am able to exercise a short time. Now I am able to exercise a long time. I also walk on the road for a long time.
