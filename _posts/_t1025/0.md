Hi, I just 'discovered' TP last week. I have memorized 30 vocabularywords so far and completed the lessons on basic sentence structure,direct objects and adjectives. I am confused at how the vowel e ispronounced. Is telo pronounced tehlo or taylo? Is wile pronouncedweeleh or weelay? How is the e which introduces the direct objectpronounced, eh or ay?I am looking forward to the day when I can post to this group in bothTP and English. Hopefully it won't be very long.Thanks in advance for your help.Dave Raftery
