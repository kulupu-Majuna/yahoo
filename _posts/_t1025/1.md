>Subject: \[tokipona\] Question on pronunciation of vowel eTo: [tokipona@yahoogroups.comDate](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.comDate): Tuesday, 24 February, 2009, 11:11 AM Hi, I just 'discovered' TP last week. I have memorized 30 vocabularywords so far and completed the lessons on basic sentence structure,direct objects and adjectives. I am confused at how the vowel e ispronounced. Is telo pronounced tehlo or taylo? Is wile pronouncedweeleh or weelay? How is the e which introduces the direct objectpronounced, eh or ay?I am looking forward to the day when I can post to this group in bothTP and English. Hopefully it won't be very long.Thanks in advance for your help.Dave Raftery New Email addresses available on Yahoo!Get the Email name you've always wanted on the new @ymail and @rocketmail.Hurry before someone else does![http://mail.promotions.yahoo.com/newdomains/aa/](http://mail.promotions.yahoo.com/newdomains/aa/)\[Non-text portions of this message have been removed\]
