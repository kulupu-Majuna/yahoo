In working up some comments on the DDJ trat for today, I was reminded of "Assoon a good thingsare called good, evil arises." Never mind the couple of dozen things this linemight mean, theissue is how to translate it to tp in a fairly literal way. "jan (I amresisting three languagestrying to make me write "ona" for the subject of every translated passive)linimi \* ijo pona \*"pona" la ike li lon" But what goes in for the stars. "nimi" in this context isPPrently atransitive verb, referring to making a word (or sound string) a name (we skipover the toki pi janutala walo on "call" and "name") for something (and maybe making it a word tobegin with). Sostandardly, the direct object --
 even by tp rules --
 of "nimi" should be theword, "pona." Butwhat then of what gets the name, the good things. Possibilities:1. The above is wrong and the good things are the object with the word being acomplement to theverb. This makes good sense semantically, calling them "pona" is just a specialkind of namingthem just like going to the store is a special kind of going.2. Like 1 except that the name is a modifier (i.e., takes "pi" if extended --
in the present case1 and 2 are indistinguishable). This doesn't fit so well with other uses, sincethe "possessor" isusually the thing named.3. So thenm back to the originally suggested pattern with the verb modified orcomplemented by theobject names (modified is probably better, since it fits with the usage justcited).4. The objects named are referred to by the object of the preposition "tawa,"again following acommon pattern (we give a name after all).sina pilin e seme?(I have trouble with "as soon as," too --
 and "when" clauses as opposed to "if"clauses generally,but that is another note.)
