> According to Sonja, just soweli will do.The official vocabulary says that, but I doubt that in practice theword is used that way. Whenever I read "soweli", in any context, Idon't think about "animal" in general.

>>"cute animal noise" can mean "cute (animal noise)" or "(cute animal)noise". In both cases, the meaning is too narrow... "jan mu" can beused to describe a kind of animal in some context (cute animals thatmake some noise or animal that make a nice noise), but not "animal"in general.pipi mute en kala mute en akesi mute en soweli mute li mu. taso onamute li mu ike! :-)When I started learning TP I had the idea (I dont't remember why,perhaps I read a bad translation somewhere) that "jan" is used for"individual" beings, both persons and animals. Now I remeber thatbecause of your expresion "jan mu".jan Mako--
