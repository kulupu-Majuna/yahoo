> "ijo lon tawa" (moving alive thing)?It looks strange to me. I think "lon" really does not mean "alive",though it can be used in that sense in some contexts... In fact,something "awake" must be "alive" (except a robot!). I can not thinka better choice now...<< lon prep be (located) in/at/onvi be there, be present, be real/true, exist, be awake 
>>... maybe "moli" could be useful? All living things must die."ijo moli tawa" thing that dies (can die) and moves...? Though itneeds a very good context! It can mean "Terminator" too: thing thatkills while moving! :-DAnother one:"ijo tawa pi ken moli" ?jan Mako--
