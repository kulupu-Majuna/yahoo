>I read somewhere about this Australian Aboriginal language that has nowords for "left" and "right," but uses north/south/east/west/etc. instead.So for that, we could say "nasin lete" for north and "nasin seli" forsouth (reverse those if you're in the Southern Hemisphere, and ifyou're talking to someone in the other hemisphere by phone or e-mail,you could say "nasin pi ma Antasika" for "south"); west could be"nasin suno" (because that's the direction the sun goes), and eastcould be "nasin monsi suno" ("the direction behind the sun").Or if you like "left" and "right," how about "nasin sitelen" for"right" and "nasin pi sitelen Alapi" for "left?" (If you're talkingto someone whose language reads right-to-left, say "nasin pi sitelenLoma" for "right.")jan Sosuwa
