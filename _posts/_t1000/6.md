I prefer to say "poka pi suno kama" for right; "poka pi suno weka"for left, since we are talking about left and right.After all, if we look at a world map, east will point to our right;west, to our right. As for north and south, I belive "lete" and "seli" (aside from coldand hot) are used for north and south regardless of the locations ofthe speaker and the person spoken to.jan Pusa---
