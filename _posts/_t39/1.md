At first, I thought the same thing, but then I realized that five-vowel
phonologies typically have three underlying unstressed vowels (often
written /a/, /e/, /o/).

\<iki\> vs. \<ike\> was a problem because unstressed \<i\> and \<e\> map nearly
allophonically to the same underlying vowel. \<ala\> vs. \<ale\> isn't as
much of a problem because unstressed /a/ is psychoacoustically further
from /e/ than /e/ from /i/.
