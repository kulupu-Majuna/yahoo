In usage, it has bothered me... perhaps theoretically it should not, but I
pronounce 'ala' like 'allah'... 'alleh' is very close sounding when both are
short. Theoretically, I have no problem with it, and if I were to have more
command of the language so that I did not tend to slur words because I am
remembering them literally as I say them, it would probably not be an issue,
so I do not believe it needs to be changed.

I did not like 'iki', but for different reasons... I did not like the verbal
length of the word, compared to its usage as a quick pronoun. 'eekee' is a
very distinct word that is hard to enounciate without slurring... with the
usage it gets, that made it cumbersome. 'ona' is far friendlier to say.
