Has there been any consideration to making a change to ale or ala, with similar
motivation as iki->ona? I personally tend to confuse them in quick speech,
either listening, or forgetting to clearly enunciate the differnce myself.

Any thoughts? Do people see this as an analagous problem to iki/ike?
