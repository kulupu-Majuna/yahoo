Hi, im new to Toki Pona. In fact i just finished reading through thelessons on the website. This really is a great language, by the way.Its easy to learn and it sounds cool too.I have some comments and questions:How do I talk about doing things cooperatively; other people and me orjust other people doing things together in a cooperative manor.How do i talk about different shades of green in the same context?jelo laso, laso jelo? are there more ways? laso suli, laso lili? Can iadd any combination of qualifiers to a color?--------
