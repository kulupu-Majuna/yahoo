>>> jan MakoI would read that as "the number year of number 1 + 9 + ..."If I wanted to say, for example, "the year 1984," I would say, "tenposike pi nanpa tu wan pi luka pi luka pi luka pi luka en tu tu pi lukapi luka en luka tu tu" or "tenpo sike pi nanpa tu wan pi luka pi wawatu tu en tu tu pi luka pi luka en luka tu tu." This is by analogy to"luka pi luka" for 25, which I saw on a tp site. "en" is by analogyto archaic English "four-and-twenty," to French "vingt-et-un"("twenty-and-one"), Spanish "diez y siete" ("ten and seven"), etc.jan Sosuwa
