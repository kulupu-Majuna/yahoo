I'm not quite clear how this is to work, but it seems to me to involve more maththan I am willingto do on the fly. For numbers that are name (in effect), not functioningquantifiers, I thinkhaving a way to read off the digits is the best plan. The "en" convention seemsas good as most(unless we gwet distinctive number names) and the fact that it does not fit thetextbookdewscription merely means that (as we know) the text book did not deal with evenmildly bignumbers.---
