 The house of Keli and her boyfriend is big.jan lili pi jan Ken en jan Lisa li suwi. --
 Ken and Lisa's baby is sweet.In both of jan Pije's examples, "en" joins two noun phrases after "pi".  In your example, "en" joins two modifiers without a noun after "pi".  I don't think jan Pije's examples justify your usage.  jan Setepo / stevo
