Is there any notion of truth and falsehood in Toki Pona? Seems like this
wouldn't necessarily be excluded from the language, but I haven't come across
it.

Toki Pona seems to be based on facts. The simple truths of the world around
us. Is there a way to say that something is false? Or even, perhaps, fake? A
concept for phony, fake, illegitimate, false.

Or is truth so fundamental that anything false can get lumped in with \<ike\>?
Comments?
