Nice to have. I hope others add websites, although this list already containssome new stuff.BUT"lukin lon e toki pona" is supposed to mean what? If "e" really marks thedirect object (of"lukin" necessarily --
 unless "lukin" is meant to take some unexplained modalstatus), the we havethe problem of what sort of looking place-looking is, since "lon" modifies"lukin". On the otherhand, if "lon" is a preposition, then there should be no "e." From what you sayjust below, I takeit you mean "lukin lon" to mean "look at," but "lon" is "at" on in the placementsense; "look at"is just "lukin e" (the line below say, "Look around this message" (or where youare)," not "lookat this item.") All that nit-picking aside, this looks like a nice addition totools for tpers.---
