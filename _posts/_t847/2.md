>it looks like lon is a verb only if it ispreceded by li, and otherwise it is like a preposition.  So that would bea preposition plus the object particle, which is kind of redundant. Since lonis modifying the verb to indicate lukin at a place (in/on/around), maybe itshould be adverbial,10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy;"

> Nice to have. I hope others add websites, althoughthis list already contains some new stuff. BUT"lukin lon e toki pona" is supposed to mean what? If "e"really marks the direct object (of"lukin" necessarily --
 unless "lukin" is meant to take someunexplained modal status), the we havethe problem of what sort of looking place-looking is, since "lon"modifies "lukin". On the otherhand, if "lon" is a preposition, then there should be no"e." From what you say just below, I takeit you mean "lukin lon" to mean "look at," but"lon" is "at" on in the placement sense; "lookat"is just "lukin e" (the line below say, "Look around thismessage" (or where you are)," not "lookat this item.") All that nit-picking aside, this looks like a niceaddition to tools for tpers. ---
