Just thought I should pass on my knowledge to all you guys (and gals) on here. Iknow just like heaps of other men I am pretty shy when it comes to going up tosomeone. I've tried a few different places (clubs, bars, etc) but never seem tohave too much luck. Anyway, a few weeks ago I joined up tohttp://[http://www.whereyougethookedup.info/tgaf](http://www.whereyougethookedup.info/tgaf) and I have to say I am already gettingexcited. I was beginning to think I'd end up being alone for ever, but alreadybeen talking to a few interested ladies on there. Anyway, if you're like me itcomes highly recommended!
