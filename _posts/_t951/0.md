I know I've been asking all the questions lately, but here's one moreparticular problem I'm having. With embedded statements, we use the"ni:" construction:mi sona e ni: musi Mawijo li pona tawa sina.I know you like the Mario games.But how would I translate a sentence like this:If I say, "Will you please go now?", will you go?I know there's a "mi toki e ni:" and a "la" somewhere... how is thisconstruction handled?jan Sosuwa
