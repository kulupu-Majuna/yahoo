>> jan "amelija" li toki e toki awen "toki pi jan sin".Hmm... now that I think about it, quotations aren't needed forquoting something someone said. All that is needed is a colon beforethe utterance ("jan li toki e ni: ali li pona"). See more about thisbelow.As for works, I don't know. Let's talk more about this later.

> (or the same glyph flipped or rotated?) to mark the end of it?As mentioned above, I don't know if we'll really need to usequotations with works. What do you think? As for quoted utterances,I would prefer just to use the colon and be done with it. \*shrug\* Ithink there should be a simple glyph or diacritic for foreign wordsand that is all. What is everyone else's opinion?(By the way, do you want to keep this discussion here or move itover to the forums on my site? I feel like I keep asking this,sorry, but nobody's been posting on my site and it's a pain tomaintain everyday without visitors. ![:P](images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz"))-jan Kowiwww.tokipona.bravehost.com
