Somewhere I read some advice on how to adapt a loan word for TokiPona, but I can't find it now. It might have been in the lessons attokipona.org, which are now off-line. Does anyone have a copy or a URLfor it? It was probably only a few paragraphs, so maybe you could justpost it here.By the way, one of my minor criticisms of jan Pije's lessons is theuse of the terms "official" and "unofficial". I think that sounds fartoo bureaucratic. Perhaps "native", "loan" and "foreign" are better terms.toki pona <- nativejan Pije <- loansitelen tawa X-Files <- foreign
