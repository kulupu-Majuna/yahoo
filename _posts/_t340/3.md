Once one has created or tokiponaised a loan word, how does one theninform or register the word for others to use? For example, just totest out my toki pona, I'm just trying little translations of varioustexts at my desk at work, and came across the word Phoenician (Ithink that's how it's spelled in toki Inla), which I rendered "maPonisi".Although I suppose not likely (unless we get a sudden rush ofPhoenicians learning toki pona, but you never know), what if someonealso working on such a translation were to render it differently,e.g. ma Pinisi? Which would be right?
