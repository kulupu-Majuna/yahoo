What are your thoughts on what a Toki-Pona-apeaking culture might belike? I imagine they would live in a desert, with a lifestyle somewhatlike the Kalahari bush tribes, because the small vocabulary suggeststhat there aren't a whole lot of things to name. I would also guessthat it started out as some kind of creole, because of its lack ofmetaphorical language.Any other ideas?jan Sosuwa
