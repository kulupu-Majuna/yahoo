It's funny, I imagine something simular, yet opposite of a desert. Iimagine if toki pona were to have occurred naturally, it would havebeen on an isolated tropical island. Sort of like a desert in the sensethat it is isolated and such. Then again, I could have just thoughtthat sense the language resembles something like Hawai'ian or Japanese.Either way, toki pona would have been spoken by a close knit group ortribe as you said. And, in fact isn't it spoken by a "small group" atthe time being? Interesting thought.jan Anti (Andy)---
