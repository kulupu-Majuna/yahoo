toki! mi Lejanto! mi jan Pasila! That's all I can say in Toki Pona fornow. I'm taking Pije's "o kama sona e toki pona lessons"<[http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson0.html](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson0.html)\
> and havealready a few questions. Please be so kind and answer to me:1) I've tokiponized my name, Leandro (pronounced, in Portuguese,leh-AN-dro) to Lejanto (which I think should be pronounced le-JAN-to),according to the "Tokiponization guidelines" in<[http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/learn/tpize.html](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/learn/tpize.html)\
>. Is it correct?2) And by the way, I've taken a look at the names of coutries in<[http://www.tokipona.org/ma.html](http://www.tokipona.org/ma.html)\
> and found out my country's name,Brazil, is "Pasila" in Toki Pona. Do you guys and girls know why"Pasila", not "Pasilo" or "Pasile" or anything else? And should I sayPA-si-la (following the rule "the accent is on the first syllable") orpa-SI-la (following the tokiponization guideline "use the colloquialpronunciation that locals actually and commonly use" --
 forBrazilians, and Portuguese speakers, say bra-ZEEL, not BRA-zeel)?3) Still on pronunciation and locations (I do want to speak Toki Pona,rather than write it, and teach it my four-year-old daughter), how doI say America's name, Amelika, and other names with more than threesyllables? A-me-li-ka? a-ME-li-ka?I thank you all for the attention given.LejantoSAY NO TO PIRACY: USE FREE SOFTWARE!
