toki!Some time back, jan Tan (Dan) sent some information about a request for inclusion of Toki Pona in ISO 639-3. Has anyone taken up the issue, completing the relevant form?If not, I think we should do that soon. Having an ISO 639-3 code can be important, e.g. for getting included into OmegaWiki (a wiki-database for dictionaries). (If no one else gets on with it, I might do it in June, i.e. after finishing my university exams).jan Moku.
