First of all, thank you for "kama pona"-ing me here and pointing outmy mistakes. I appreciate that.This may be covered in the lessons at tokipona.esperanto-jeunes.org,but I haven't finished going through them and was half asleep lastnight when I looked at the first several.Can nuances of meaning be expressed in the order of modifiers? Forinstance:jan suli melijan meli suliDo they mean, respectively, "a big/important/tall/adult person who isa woman" and "a woman who is big (implying big for a woman)?"
