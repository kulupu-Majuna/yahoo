Almost certainly, but we don't have enough cases to be clear about what it is. In particular, itis not clear whether or just what the difference is between a woman who is big(in some sense) anda big person who is a woman. Those are clearly the two readings involved. Isuspect that therelativization of "big" is one factor but ther may be others --
 beyond mattersof emphasis.---
