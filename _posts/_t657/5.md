> This brings me to ask: Does jan lili mute mean "many children" or "a veryyoung baby"? Or is this just the ambiguity of tp?jan lili mute means many children. jan pi lili mute means a very youngbaby. Every modifier modifies the whole part it follows. So in janlili mute, mute applies to jan lili. pi is meant to change thisbehavior, anything following pi applies to the part it follows: in janpi lili mute, lili mute applies to jan.
