I've written all the lessons for the new Toki Pona course "o kamasona e toki pona!". There are 18 lessons. Of course, there's no waythat I've covered every aspect of the language in these lessons, butthey're much superior to the ones from tokipona.org.[http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/lesson/lesson0.htmlAt](http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/lesson/lesson0.htmlAt) long last, you can no longer say that you won't study Toki Ponabecause it's not taught fully enough. But even if you don't actuallywant to go through the course to learn the language, there are manytopics discussed in the lessons that have never before been formallydiscussed and available for everyone to see.Marr, I think you should replace the old tokipona.org lessons withthese new ones or at least give a link to them. I worked very hard onthem.For some reason I get the idea that many people who read these postsdo just that --
 read. Read and don't respond. But anyhow, that's anissue for another time. If you DO have any comments, email me [atkurum3@aol.com](mailto://atkurum3@aol.com) or post back to this message board, of course.mi tawa lape. (lape a!)jan Pije
