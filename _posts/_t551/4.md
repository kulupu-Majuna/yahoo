Note that, except for having to be first, "e" is a preposition (this would cutdown on the therules a smidge). And I am not sure "e" does have to be firstWhat preceeds "la" does not have to be a Nominal; it can be Sentence (or did Imiss a rulesomewhere.Need a rule of some sort for "kin" (perhaps just a transformation that allows itafter (almost)any word).How do we do negative propeositions? is Preposition + "ala" also Preposition?("without", "awayfrom" --
 or is "weka" also Preposition? --
 and so on)I would expect your grammatical categories to change quite a bit as more userscome on the scene:many words have a potential to operate in almost every category, even thoughthis potential hasnot yet been realized ("ilo" as a preposition, for example, although "kepeken"has taken thatslot).---
