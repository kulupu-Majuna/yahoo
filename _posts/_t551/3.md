\[en\]Do you think your results could somehow be used in Prolog? Having received rules like that, this computer language is capable of telling if a sample sentence is a valid sentence within the system or not. It can also tell if there are several possible results of analyzing the structure. This would be very handy in connection with a machine translator, which would be then capable of providing translations of a very good quality.It would also be helpful to have someone else doublecheck the grammar to point out errors or gaps.stevo / jan Setepo
