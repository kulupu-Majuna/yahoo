Do you think your results could somehow be used in Prolog? Having received rules like that, this computer language is capable of telling if a sample sentence is a valid sentence within the system or not. It can also tell if there are several possible results of analyzing the structure. This would be very handy in connection with a machine translator, which would be then capable of providing translations of a very good quality.ken.It's possible.  I'm not sure that Prolog would be the best language to do it in, but I don't know of a better one, either.  A parser would be very helpful in improving machine translation, I would think.jan setepo / stevo
