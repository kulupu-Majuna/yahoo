Note that, except for having to be first, "e" is a preposition (this would cut down on the therules a smidge).  And I am not sure "e" does have to be firstThis is good point, but it feels more special than a mere preposition.  What preceeds "la" does not have to be a Nominal; it can be Sentence  (or did I miss a rulesomewhere.P2 <PreSentence
> ::= \["taso"\] <Sentence
> "la"       | \["taso"\] <Nominal
> "la"Need a rule of some sort for "kin" (perhaps just a transformation that allows it after (almost)any word)."kin" is a modifier, so it can follow a noun or a verb.  Can it be used elsewhere?How do we do negative propeositions?  is Preposition + "ala" also Preposition? ("without", "awayfrom" --
 or is "weka" also Preposition? --
 and so on)Are there negated prepositions?  I haven't seen any yet, but I'm still pretty new at tp.I would expect your grammatical categories to change quite a bit as more users come on the scene:many words have a potential to operate in almost every category, even though this potential hasnot  yet been realized ("ilo" as a preposition, for example, although "kepeken" has taken thatslot).---
