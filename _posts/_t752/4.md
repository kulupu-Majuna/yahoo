But a dog came and thecat ran away."A story like this one is not too specific and lieswithin the limits of experience of almost all humanson earth. But you cannot translate :\*"soweli li wile moku e soweli. taso soweli li kama.soweli li tawa wawa li weka."\*You will obviously have o specify "soweli" and writesomething like that :"soweli pi linja uta li wile moku e soweli lili. tasosoweli pi awen tomo li kama. soweli pi linja uta litawa wawa li weka."I think, these word lists are not to be considered asdictionaries, but as suggestions how to express anidea in a context-related manner.Fran√ßois Schwicker\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
