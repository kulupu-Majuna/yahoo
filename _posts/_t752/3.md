*   ...nimi sina pi nimi mute li ike.I don't like the idea of mapping English words. Why not just come upwith a TP phrase to represent each letter of the English alphabet,then you could spell out any words you want!The vocabulary of Toki Pona is deliberately limited and vague. I LIKEit that way.Look at cats and rats and cows and tigers and say, "soweli"... and letyour mind get used to it. Look at trees and grass and flowers andwooden stuff and say, "kasi"... and let it be okay.Please don't try to translate the great literature into Toki Pona.Don't try to express complex or minutely detailed scenes or concepts.It's a simple language. Think simply.It's good that way.
