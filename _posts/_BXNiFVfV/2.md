As a person who has tried to write a book of this sort, I can assure you that early optimistic guess about how long it will take are sure to be overly optimistic and , as the project goes along, the time to the end seems to get ever longer and longer. But eventually it comes, hopefully not too late to help  
  
and not much after the time given in the last guess (authors tend to stop guessing after a while). o awen e pilin pona tawa jan Sonja en lipu ona.

Sometimes I even wonder if the announcement of a book wasn't just a big joke of Sonja's... :-D
