jan ali o, toki!  
   
kulupu nimi "ilo ni li pi sina" li ike mute tawa mi tan ni: "li" precedes a predicate (verb or verbal adjective) but not "pi". pi is used to make clear that an specifying addition comprising at least two words relates to the preceding basic word (such as "tomo tawa pi sike mute") which denotes that "sike mute" is related to "tomo tawa" and not to "tomo" alone. I would translate "this tool is yours" as "ilo ni li ilo sina". If the object possessed is a longer expression, I think the "sina jo e..." form is good.   
Regarding "sina pali seme e ni", I'm not sure whether this is acceptable tp at all because the meaning "what did you do with it" would make "what" a direct object (e seme), and we would have to find a nice solution for "with it" (tawa ni?) So, I would propose "sina pali e seme tawa ni" just to avoid the wordy "kepeken nasin seme" construction.

According to what you really mean, there are several possibilities:  
  
mi sona ala e ali pi toki pona (I don't know everything about TP)  
mi ken ala toki pona lon toki pona (I can't speak well in TP)  
mi sona pona ala e toki pona (I don't know TP well)

The sentence "sina pali seme e ni" doesn't really mean "How did you make this?" but rather "What did you make with this?". "kepeken nasin seme" is actually the best translation of "how". I sometimes use "sama seme" (like what) but it's not as clear.

"ma li pona lukin tawa mi" is good Toki Pona, but it will be heard with the intended meaning "the countryside is good looking to me" only if you're indeed watching the coutryside, or if there's a picture of it above your text, or if you've already been speaking about the coutryside, and so on. In Toki Pona it's the context that makes the meaning. Adding a precision like "ma ni" can be usefull, if not indispensable.  
  
You have to split your sentence up when it's too complicated to be expressed without a la-clause. And if it still remains too complicated, then just try to say the same thing in a simpler way.  
  
The syntax "ilo ni li pi sina" is a clever invention of jan Pije's, but I'm not sure many of us do use it actually. Most of the time, TP will force you to speak more directly.
