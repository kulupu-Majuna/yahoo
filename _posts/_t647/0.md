it would be good if someone started a toki pona group on myspace.is there any other groups that could be like that else-where too?not that i hate this group of toki pona on yahoo, but it does look abit messy in the messages section, most of which are just little replysto topics.i'm a new member but havnt really posted yet. i dont really speak tokipona, so please talk to me in english untill otherwize.but the lanaguge seems fun, and when i've stopped being lazy, i mighthave a better look at it. ^\_^ok, cya
