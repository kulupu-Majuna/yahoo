As far as I know, there are toki pona groups in these socialnetworking sites:Orkut:[http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=36101LiveJournal:http://community.livejournal.com/tokipona/Amikumu.com:A](http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=36101LiveJournal:http://community.livejournal.com/tokipona/Amikumu.com:A) brand new Esperanto social networking site, where you can set tokipona as one of the languages you can speak, though there are no thingslike communities so far.I am not a member in other social networking sites, so unfortunately Ican't give you an advice on MySpace or so.jan MaleJT wrote:
