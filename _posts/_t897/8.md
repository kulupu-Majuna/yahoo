toki,I had in mind, "firstly"I suppose I could have said, "mi pana wan e ilo tawa jan" or avoidedadverbs altogether, "mi pana e ilo wan tawa jan" but that shifts themeaning slightly, from doing the first of many actions to giving thefirst of many things to give.wan la mi moku pini e kili. First I'll finish eating an apple.mi moku pini wan e kili. ? wan modifies completely, which doesn't helpmi moku wan pini e kili. ? pini modifies firstly, which doesn't helpmi moku pini moku wan e kili. ? I'm not sure this is grammatical,but it does keep the adverbs from interfering with each otherall of these examples suffer from an inability to differentiatecardinal from ordinal (singularly, firstly)
>> poki kama pi waso telo – water fowl typing, duck typing
>ni li seme?Duck typing is a phrase from computer programming language analysis,where types (think parts of speech), are determined by how they areused, not by how they are declared (think dictionary look up). Thename comes from the dictum, "If it walks like a duck, talks like aduck, it's a duck"I'm not sure where the profession modifier should go for professionsand credentials. It strikes me as a question of style.mi tawa,jan Matthew Martin-----

> poki – box, abstractly—category
> poki kama – to put in a box, to categorize, to type"poki kama" li "poki". A "poki kama" must be some kind of "kama"(apparently, a coming one, or one used to make something happen...).I'm a little sleepy while writing this yet, but I'd say "to putsomething in a box" is "(li) (kama) lon e ijo lon poki" or "(li) kamae ijo lon poki".
