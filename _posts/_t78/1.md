> Thank you!pona! Kasije! (in Pije-Lamentian dialect)
> We waited a long time for him.tenpo mute la mi mute li wile e ni: ona li kama.
> That is an easy question.ni li toki pona. OR, mi sona e ni.
> Can you help me?sina ken ala ken pali e ijo tawa mi?
> The meaning of this picture is clear.sitelen ni li pona. OR, mi sona e sitelen ni. OR, mi sona e nasin pi sitelenni. Or something like that.
> He is learning a more difficult language.ona li kama sona e toki suli. (There're no relative comparisons in toki pona)
> I received your letter.mi kama jo e lipu sina.
> The fridge is wide but not very tall or long.You can't say that.
> The bottle is still almost full.tenpo ni la poki li jo e telo mute li jo e kon lili.
> She is frightened of him.mije ni li ike tawa meli ni.Anyway, most of those sentences are ones that you would not use in tokipona.Instead you'd have to simplify them along with their context. This is why the'literal' translations look ugly and incomplete.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & Morehttp://faith.yahoo.com
