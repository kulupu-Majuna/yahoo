Afaik, Esperanto earlier used to have no anthonims(or however it spells in english) - all words of opposite meaning werecreated by adding mal-. If we copy this tendention to toki pona, thevocabulary would dramatically decrease.P.S. It's all just plain theoretical discussion. Don't think i'm goingto really change something in toki pona.--
