Of course, they all agreed that thelanguage needed"perfecting" first and pretty much agreed on what "perfection" meant. For tp,the differentpurposes have given rise to different ideas of perfection as well.

 if the numbers involvedget at all large. Figuring out orders of magnitude is a puzzle (in spoken presenation, of course--
 in writing youcan just count digits). Hence the proposal for tp to have a magnitude marker atthe beginning --
and as needed in the middle as well. But that is controversial, to put itmildly.

On the other hand, it iseasier in tp tocome up with explanatory paraphrases because there are so few grammaticalsructures to deal with.I'm not sure that much in the way of further indicators is called for, eventhough context doesnot always decide.
