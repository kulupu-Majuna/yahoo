I appreciated its fascinating grammar, its richstructures... and the difficult to use it all together in normalpractice, when most of that things are not needed and constraint alot. Of course I knew the goal of the language at first, so it wasn'ta dissappointment. It was a pleasure to learn something about a suchdifferent language. I love programming computers, so you can imaginethe thrill.Also a simple number system similar to Lojban would be appreciated. Ithink the "digit" solution of Lojban is efficient and "pona" and itis not limited to the decimal system. It wouldn't conflict with theactual TP numbers. That would let me write some very "ike mute"expressions like "2007-04-27" ![;-)](images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink") instead of "tenpo sike mute mutemute mute mute..." ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") in my new TP web pages and --
