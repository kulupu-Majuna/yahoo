(little round picture) anu 'sitelen sike pilili mute' anu ijo sama ni.I've also been trying to find a song (modern) that could have tokipona lyrics, but it is sooo hard to express alot in few syllables!and the need of grammatical particles add to that toughness. Maybelittle nursery songs, but that's about it. I love music, and Tokiponawould be a great addition... too bad I'm not a great singer, lol.
