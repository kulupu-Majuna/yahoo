According to the dictionary http://www.tokipona.org/nimi.html, "tawa"  
can also mean "go to", and with this meaning, the sentence is all right.  
  
Another interesting thing to me is that in the sentence "jan San o tawa  
tomo sina", the single "o" seems to indicate both vocative (calling  
John) and imperative (telling John what to do). This construction seems  
smart to me, but I wonder if it is right.
