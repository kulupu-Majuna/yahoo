"tawa" works as a verb + preposition sometimes: mi tawa tomo sina = I'm going  
to your house.  
  
I never got around to fixing that Phrase Structure grammar in the Wikipedia  
article. I guess I should do that.  
Have you seen the grammar as it's written in message 2313 in this list's  
archives?  
That's about the most up-to-date version of it.  
I don't know who put the PS grammar in the Wikipedia article, but it's not  
very accurate.
