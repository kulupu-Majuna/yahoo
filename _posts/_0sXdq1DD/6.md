Wow. You weren't kidding.  
  
The sentence in the group introduction:  
sina ken tawa weka tan kulupu kepeken nimi ni  
Could be parsed the following ways by my parser:  
  
You Equals(absent moving possibility)Conj(from:group)Conj(with:referred name))  
You Equals(absent moving possibility)Conj(from:referred named usable group))  
You Equals(communal original absent moving possibility)Conj(with:referred name))  
You Equals(possibility)Conj(towards:absence)Conj(from:group)Conj(with:referred name))  
You Equals(possibility)Conj(towards:absence)Conj(from:referred named usable group))  
You Equals(possibility)Conj(towards:communal original absence)Conj(with:referred name))  
You Equals(possibility)Conj(towards:referred named usable communal original absence))  
You Equals(referred named usable communal original absent moving possibility))  
You Modal(can)Verb(absent move)Conj(from:referred named usable group))  
You Modal(can)Verb(communal original absent move)Conj(with:referred name))  
You Modal(can)Verb(referred named usable communal original absent move))  
You Verb(absent moving enable)Conj(from:referred named usable group))  
You Verb(communal original absent moving enable)Conj(with:referred name))  
You Verb(enable)Conj(towards:referred named usable communal original absence))  
You Verb(referred named usable communal original absent moving enable))
