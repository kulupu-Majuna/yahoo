True, it has got duplicates.  
  
But I updated the list (to take account for a grammar update),  
it's now got 24 unique.  
  
The thing I changed was that I changed this:  
predicate1: simplenounphrase prepo\_list  
| verb\_phrase prepositional\_phrase  
| verb\_phrase;  
  
into this:  
predicate1: simplenounphrase prepo\_list  
| verb\_phrase prepo\_list  
| verb\_phrase;  
  
Although the Wikipedia article tells that a verb phrase can take  
only one prepositional phrase and a noun phrase can take any number,  
I think it's better if both can take any number.
