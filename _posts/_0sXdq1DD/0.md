Hi, I'm trying to understand the rules of Tokipona grammar.  
  
At http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson9.html  

> John, go to your house.  
> jan San o (John,) + o tawa tomo sina (Go to your house.)  
> jan San o tawa tomo sina.  
> 

As I understand it, "tawa" here works as a preposition ("towards")  
to "tomo sina", and not as a verb ("go").  
  
However, if it is not a verb, then the predicate of this sentence  
is incomplete. According to the syntax description at Wikipedia \[1\]  
and \[2\], the verb is a mandatory part\* of the predicate, followed  
optionally by some prepositional phrases. "tawa tomo sina" is a  
prepositional phrase.  
  
If, on the other hand, I misunderstood and "tawa" works as a verb  
here and not as a preposition, shouldn't there be also be a preposition?  
I.e. "jan San o tawa tawa tomo sina" (Person John lo, Go to house yours)  
  
  
\*) A noun phrase can also do, but neither exists in this sentence.
