Yes, in fact I linked to it in my message.  
  
However, I noticed a mistake in my deduction -- the Wikipedia article  
indeed indicates as you said it should:  
The verb part of the predicate, which I was refering to, in fact  
is defined as a verb OR "tawa" / "lon" followed by a noun phrase.  
  
Thank you for the reply anyway.
