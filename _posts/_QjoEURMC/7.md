I think chatting with people is more helpful. People can suggest  
interesting themes for discussions and correct mistakes.  
There is official Toki Pona chat, but it is not used for practicing  
in Toki Pona. Visitors of this chat send messages in English.  
  
We can create new chat, for practicing only. Or we can appoint time  
for meeting in offitial chat.  
Is this solution of practicing problem acceptable for you?  
  
Does anybody want to practice in chat?  
Maybe this chat already exists, but we do not know about it. Does  
anybody know about such chat?
