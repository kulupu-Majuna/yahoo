Who's "we" who don't mind ...? mi wile e ni: jan mute mute li kama sona li kepeken e toki pona. mi lape la mi pilin e ni: jan sin li kama lon li kama sona e toki pi nanpa wan. toki ni li toki pona. tenpo kama la, ona li ken kama sona e toki ante kin. That would be the first native tp speaker 8-)) who at some time could tell us which words/notions to add and which to delete to make tp a really and easily usable language.  
tenpo sikeÂ sin o pana e pona tawa jan ali.

We don't mind if only a few people can speak Toki Pona. It's often an  
nice advantage when you don't mean to be understood by too many. But  
I'm not sure a robot would be a fine TP speaker - not to say anything  
about violating strongly the very spirit of this language...
