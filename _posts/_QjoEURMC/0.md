Hello,  
  
I have an idea that I thought would be helpful for those learning  
toki pona. I believe that if a chatterbot is generated with toki pona  
communication abilities, it would provide good practice for those  
interested in learning the language, and would ultimately lead more  
people to more experience with the language. People could practice  
their knowledge, since face it, not many people know toki pona as of  
now. Maybe add this to the site. What does everyone else think?  
  
yan, Andi
