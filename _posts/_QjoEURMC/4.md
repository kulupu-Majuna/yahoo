lape la mi pilin e ni: jan sin li kama lon li kama sona e toki pi  
nanpa wan. toki ni li toki pona. tenpo kama la, ona li ken kama sona e  
toki ante kin. That would be the first native tp speaker 8-)) who at  
some time could tell us which words/notions to add and which to delete  
to make tp a really and easily usable language.

Your dream that people learn TP as their first language might get a  
symbolic interpretation - maybe you'd like everyone to have good  
thoughts. Now, do you really think it would be a nice thing to do to  
raise children exclusively in Toki Pona - as this could make them  
unable to learn a more complex language?
