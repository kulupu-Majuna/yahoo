toki tawa ali! This is my first attempt at translating somethinginto Toki Pona. I used a small (very small!) story I found on a pagefor some conlang translation exercises. I want everyone to tell meany ways they think the wording could be improved, and especially ifthere are any grammatical or spelling mistakes! I'm a perfectionist,so hit me hard! ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\---
English Original:---
Father, what are those lights?That is the city of the Goyanim. They are a strange people. Theylight their cities at night, as if the stars weren't sufficient fortheir needs. They fight and kill each other, not realising thegreater danger beyond their small world. And they do not hunt eachother with bows and arrows. No, they have strange devices that killfrom far away without arrows. And take care near their strange ironhorses they use to travel. They travel faster than any natural beastought to, and ignore the strength of the bow and arrow. Best if youavoid their cities, my son.Father, what's a city?---

Retranslation from TP:---
Father, what are those lights?That is the city Goyanim. Those people are crazy. At night they usemany lights, but they don't think that the stars (lit. "upper/skylights") are good lights. They fight a lot, but they don'tknow/realize that much fighting exists in other lands. They don'tuse weapons like other people's weapons. They use strange weapons.Their strange weapons don't use arrows (lit. "long, straight, woodenweapons"). Don't go by their iron horses (lit. "stone mammals").Their iron horses are like moving rooms (this could be translated ascars, though the context of the story indicates that the word "car"would not be in the father's vocab). They move very very fast(lit. "well")! They can't be destroyed using arrows (again,lit. "long, straight, wooden weapons")! My child, go not to theircities.Father, what is a city?
