> in lesson 6 if adverbs follow the verb .Hi Matthias,Don't try thinking of TP words as "verbs", "adverbs" or some such. They reallyaren't. Sometimes they act like verbs, other times like nouns or adjectives,even in the same position in a sentence.In this case, in "ma li pona lukin", "pona lukin" is more like an adjectivethan a verb. Or if you think of it as a verb, think of "is beautiful".By "ma li lukin pona" it seems you wanted to say "Country looks pretty".Unfortunately TP doesn't have any verb which would mean "look" in the sensethat it's used there. "lukin" can only mean "look AT", "see", so "lukin pona"can never mean "looks pretty".jan Nikita\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
