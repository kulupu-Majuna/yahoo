toki,Oops, Iâ€™m sorry. I read "compound verb preceded by kama" too fast and gotit backwards. Never mind what I just wrote.I should have been writing kama sona/kama jo/kama lape all along.These are the only official words I can find that have kama as a modifier,(i.e. following a word), and it means something like coming/upcoming/futuretenpo kamatenpo suno kamaBy analogy, I guess verb + kama would be equivalent to the future tense?mi toki \*tempo kama\* e toki pona pona. I will speak good toki pona someday.I know people usually write it as:\*tempo kama la\* mi toki e toki pona pona. I will speak good toki ponasomeday.mi tawa,jan Matthew Martin\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_From: [tokipona@yahoogroups.com](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.com) \[mailto:[tokipona@yahoogroups.com](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.com)\] On BehalfOf John E CliffordSent: Saturday, September 15, 2007 1:00 PMTo: [tokipona@yahoogroups.comSubject](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.comSubject): Re: \[tokipona\] question on verb "kama"---

>Can you give citations for these. I can find only "kama sona", "kama jo,"and "kama lape"in these meanings (or at all for that matter). This pattern is alsoproductive, making newexpressions with the same general meaning: "A li kama B" for A vomes to be(a) C, "A li C" becomestrue. This also accords with Chapter 6 in the Lessons (which has "kama jo"for "get").
