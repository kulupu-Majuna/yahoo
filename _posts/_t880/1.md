Kama looks like it was intended to be a special verb, not sure what the right linguistic term is, seems to mean â€œacquiring such a stateâ€sona- know, sona kama â€“ learn (both official)jo â€“ have,  jo kama â€“ receive (both official)lape â€“ sleep, lape kama â€“ fall asleep (not in the official dictionary) But this doesnâ€™t follow the patternolin --
 lovekama olin â€“ fall in love, ref. [http://www.tokipona.org/pilin.html](http://www.tokipona.org/pilin.html) Is that just a mistake, or am I missing grammatical point here?(?) ona mije li kama olin e ona meli. He came to love her.(?) ona mije li olin kama e ona meli. He fell in love with her. I think you're making too much of the English distinction between "come to love" and "fall in love with"."kama" plus verb means just "begin to" plus verb:  begin to have, begin to sleep, begin to love.  All the same.jan Setepo / stevo
