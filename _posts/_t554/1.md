Yeah; I've wondered about this too. Given the way that traditionally separateconcepts are rammedtogether in tp, sometimes in ways that do not make much sense to me, it seemsodd to have two suchclose concepts (to me to the point where I wonder if indeed they really are two)seems odd. Theyare distinct grammatically, but given the relative freedom from grammaticalcategories, thishardly seems much of a reason.---
