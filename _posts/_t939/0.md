Hi, I'm trying to understand the rules of Tokipona grammar.At [http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson9.html-](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson9.html-) there's this example:
> John, go to your house.
> jan San o (John,) + o tawa tomo sina (Go to your house.)
> jan San o tawa tomo sina.As I understand it, "tawa" here works as a preposition ("towards")to "tomo sina", and not as a verb ("go").However, if it is not a verb, then the predicate of this sentenceis incomplete. According to the syntax description at Wikipedia \[1\]and \[2\], the verb is a mandatory part\* of the predicate, followedoptionally by some prepositional phrases. "tawa tomo sina" is aprepositional phrase.If, on the other hand, I misunderstood and "tawa" works as a verbhere and not as a preposition, shouldn't there be also be a preposition?I.e. "jan San o tawa tawa tomo sina" (Person John lo, Go to house yours)\*) A noun phrase can also do, but neither exists in this sentence.\[1\] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona%5B2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona%5B2)\] [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/message/2313--
