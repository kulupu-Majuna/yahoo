At [http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson9.html-](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson9.html-) there's this example:
> John, go to your house.
> jan San o (John,) + o tawa tomo sina (Go to your house.)
> jan San o tawa tomo sina.As I understand it, "tawa" here works as a preposition ("towards")to "tomo sina", and not as a verb ("go").However, if it is not a verb, then the predicate of this sentenceis incomplete. According to the syntax description at Wikipedia \[1\]and \[2\], the verb is a mandatory part\* of the predicate, followedoptionally by some prepositional phrases. "tawa tomo sina" is aprepositional phrase.If, on the other hand, I misunderstood and "tawa" works as a verbhere and not as a preposition, shouldn't there be also be a preposition?I.e. "jan San o tawa tawa tomo sina" (Person John lo, Go to house yours)"tawa" works as a verb + preposition sometimes: mi tawa tomo sina = I'm going to your house.I never got around to fixing that Phrase Structure grammar in the Wikipedia article. Â I guess I should do that.Have you seen the grammar as it's written in message 2313 in this list's archives?That's about the most up-to-date version of it.I don't know who put the PS grammar in the Wikipedia article, but it's not very accurate.jan Setepo / stevo
