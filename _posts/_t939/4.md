According to the dictionary [http://www.tokipona.org/nimi.html](http://www.tokipona.org/nimi.html), "tawa"can also mean "go to", and with this meaning, the sentence is all right.Another interesting thing to me is that in the sentence "jan San o tawatomo sina", the single "o" seems to indicate both vocative (callingJohn) and imperative (telling John what to do). This construction seemssmart to me, but I wonder if it is right.
