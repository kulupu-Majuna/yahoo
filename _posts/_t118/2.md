 I want to comprehend the word "Su".As for the story itself, it was pretty good, based on what all I could read. Almost the entire next to the last paragraph was hazy, though; I couldn't ever quite figure out what was going on. From a literary criticism type of view, I'd say the story could use more action, but I don't think that that was the reason why you wrote the story in the first place, so it's no big deal.--
