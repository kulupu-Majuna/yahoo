I think that composite numbers such as "tu wan" or "luka luka" are to be treated as one quantifier. As for "one of a pair of sounds", I would say "wan pi kalama tu". ni li pona ala pona?

"tu wan" is two words. Why would it count as one?  
  
"kalama tu wan" would mean something like "one of a pair of sounds".
