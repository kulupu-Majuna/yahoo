>> I'd want to know if these words continue to be "tolerated" and "admitted" inTP :
>> "mi mut" for nous/usmi muteactually used, admitted for daily use, avoidable when the plurality ofthe people spoken about is already clear
>> "sina mute" for vous/you pluralcomparable story, but is much more encouraged not to use it. only useit when you really needs to get the plurality clear (I can say thatabout mi mute as well).
>> "luka" for cinq/fiveused a lot, status debatable. officially deprecated, but not alwaysavoidable and highly preferred over e.g. tu tu wanif in doubt about large numbers and it doesn't matter a lot, use "mute"
>> Personally, they don't cause any psychical trouble ! and you ?
>> And about the TP Book, somebody got news ? avez-vous des nouvelles ?Some day, really... :)She's working on it, she told me lately...
