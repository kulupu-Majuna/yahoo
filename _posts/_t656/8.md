No. I have a couple of cases but, on inspection, they are clearly wrong inother respects, sohere also. The interesting question now is what about "mi mute" and "sina ale"for example. Iassume they take "li" so the two exceptions really are very narrowly defined -lexically as wellas structurally, but not semantically.---
