No.  I have a couple of cases but, on inspection, they are clearly wrong in other respects, sohere also.  The interesting question now is what about "mi mute" and "sina ale" for example.  Iassume they take "li" so the two exceptions really are very narrowly defined - lexically as wellas structurally, but not semantically."mi mute" and "sina mute" both take "li".  I asked about this when I first joined the group, and I've seen lots of examples since then.  It's only the bare subjects "mi" and "sina" that don't take "li".jan Setepo / stevo
