a a a! ni li musi mute!  
  
This got me wondering how easily tp could develop a culture around its usage/history. Could the word Kijetesantakalu come into the language (as a name/borrowed word attribute) to refer to this incident.  
  
e.g. musi Kijetesantakalu = a practical joke (like this one), jan Kijetesantakalu = a practical joker, tenpo suno Kijetesantakalu = a day for practical jokes like April fool's day etc.  
  
are there any examples of such things happening in tokipona. (This would for example be analogous to "krokodili" in esperanto which, if i am not mistaken, refers to a crocodile in the Cseh-language course who would not speak esperanto.)
