Hey all,   I thought of a list of things we need to figure out how to do in tp, aside from big numbers:   Causatives and reflexives Undoing of actions (go --

> return, learn --

> forget, etc.) Distinction between species (dogs, cats, mice, and elephants are all soweli) Distinction between size and age ("jan lili" can be a child or an adult midget/dwarf) Relative clauses (for those of us who want to make tp more suitable for international communication--
others can feel free not to use them)   Also, I can't find how to say "why."   I thought of something.  Some words are internationally known, so might we use them for tp?  For example, I think the word for "banana" in almost every language is "banana" or something close (correct me if I'm wrong), so could we call it "kili Panana?"  These are just a few ideas I have.   Josh Ahhh...imagining that irresistible "new car" smell?
