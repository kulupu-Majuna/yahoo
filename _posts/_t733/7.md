I think another problem we have is that because of irregularities, weactually have to learn more vocabulary than we think.  For example,"jan utala" is "soldier" (i.e. "person who fights") but "jan olin" is"loved one" (i.e. "person who is loved").  There isn't a regular rule;for example, would "jan moli" be "killer" or "dead person?" I think your definitions of the phrases is too limiting.  I think of them as "fighting person" and "loving person" and then "killing person".  Same rule for all.You're imposing English grammar on Toki Pona, with predictably disastrous results.jan Setepo / stevo
