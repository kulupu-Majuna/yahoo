You can achieve a similareffect in Toki Pona using "ala", "taso", "mute", "lili"... thoughit's not exactly the same.
> Distinction between species (dogs, cats, mice, and elephants areall soweli)
> Distinction between size and age ("jan lili" can be a child or anadult midget/dwarf)I think that would be contrary to the goal of the language.Nevertheless you can make distinctions. Just \*think\* in a \*different\*simpler way (that's what Toki Pona is for). Take a look at thistranslation:[http://forfikulo.front.ru/tp_talpo.htmlThe](http://forfikulo.front.ru/tp_talpo.htmlThe) PDF version is here:[http://pokipitokipona.free.fr/sitelen.html?page3](http://pokipitokipona.free.fr/sitelen.html?page3)\
> Relative clausesYou can do it in Toki Pona indeed. It's just longer. Nevertheless,many times it's easier: just use simpler sentences.
>(for those of us who want to make tp more suitable
> for international communicationThat's not what Toki Pona was created for. There are many otherlanguages for that. Esperanto is the number one in all practicalfields (number of speakers, literature, activities...); it's asmature as many important national languages, and suitable foreverything you would ever need. It's easy, flexible and powerful.[http://esperanto.net](http://esperanto.net), [http://lernu.netToki](http://lernu.netToki) Pona is a tool to learn to think in a different, simpler way. Itcould be suitable for international communciation, but then it wouldbe a different thing. It would be an interesting project, to keep itseasy grammar, remove some irregularities, add some clearer... oops,no flame wars, please!! ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\
> Also, I can't find how to say "why."That's because there's no way to say it... in the English way. Lookat the word "seme". It's easy.Regards,Marcos--
