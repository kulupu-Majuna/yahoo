[http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson0.htmlYou](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson0.htmlYou) should learn the language as it is, first. It seems that you'remissing what Toki Pona is about. Limiting the vocabulary was the maingoal in designing the language.To say "banana" for example, ask yourself, "How important is it reallythat it's specifically a banana?" If you can point and say "kili",fine. If you have to differenciate, say "kili jelo" or "kili linja"etc.If you want an international auxiliary language, learn Esperanto.Seriously. Although Toki Pona is cute and fun and an interestingthinking tool, it's not an IAL. Esperanto really is easy, readilyavailable (see Lernu.net for example), and spoken by more people thansome of the official languages of the E.U.o kama sona e toki Epelanto!(Lernu esperanton!)
