>> BTW, what kinds of tones are you using?As I said, it seems unlikely to me that so many tonal languages wouldstill be around if they were so handicapped. I don't buy that youcan't sing a tonal language properly either, since I've heardVietnamese singing (Roman Catholic church songs, standard Westernstuff) and the tones seemed to still be there.So are you saying that it's hard for \*you\* to hear tones? or that itis difficult even for native speakers of tonal languages to hear themin "hostile" environments? And is it any harder than making out thedifferences between voiced and unvoiced consonants, for example, insuch environments? (I kept the flexible consonants of TP, by theway.)Anyway, I'm using three tones: even, rising, and falling.jan Wiko
