I trimmed it down to 8 consonants, 5 vowels, and 3 tones.  All wordswould be one syllable, strictly CV.  That gives 120 possiblesyllables, since I added the "h" consonant, a personal preference, Iuse all 3 tones of "ha" for the TP word "a".  I arbitrarily assigned"mu" and then assigned the remaining words randomly (using a Perlscript, only once).So this language of mine is a tonalized knock-off of Toki Pona.I call it (in TP), "toki pi kalama ante".Fun stuff.  I still haven't tried it out much though.jan WikoI like to think that shortening the words would help to make speaking faster, maybe even thinking, too.  Any luck with that?jan Setepo / stevo
