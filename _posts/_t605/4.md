>> Toki Pona is a minimalist language. Its words should also be minimal.I had similar thoughts, since some long words contain short words,which seems troublesome especially in the first syllable where they'reboth identically accented. But I took it a little farther than whatyou described.I trimmed it down to 8 consonants, 5 vowels, and 3 tones. All wordswould be one syllable, strictly CV. That gives 120 possiblesyllables, since I added the "h" consonant, a personal preference, Iuse all 3 tones of "ha" for the TP word "a". I arbitrarily assigned"mu" and then assigned the remaining words randomly (using a Perlscript, only once).So this language of mine is a tonalized knock-off of Toki Pona.I call it (in TP), "toki pi kalama ante".Fun stuff. I still haven't tried it out much though.jan Wiko
