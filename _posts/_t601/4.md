"li sike e suno" == "circle the sun"It's an action performed upon the sun.Your suggestion is \*less\* logical."li sike suno" == "circle brightly"? "turn sun-wise"?That would be too idiomatic.As for Esperanto's "jarcento", I disagree. Both "centjaro" and"jarcento" mean the same thing, a time span of an hundred years. It'sa difference of emphasis in this case, whether you're stressing thehundredness or the yearishness of it.Same with "regxido" vs "princo". "Princo" simply means "prince" but"regxido" stresses pedigree by calling him the son of the king. Thislittle substitution is nothing when compared to the "kennings" of OldEnglish, Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Celtic literature. "Prince" couldhave been mangled that way as "ripe seed of the blooming onion ofwar". (Yes, "onion". No, I don't get it either.)jan Wiko
