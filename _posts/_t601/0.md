Since we are asking questions today, let me ask again about when to use "e" andwhen to usemodification. The difference between "tawa B" and "tawa e B" is pretty clear. And from that, thecorresponding pair from "lon" falls into place. But now we have "sike e suno,"which, by analogy,ought to mean "spin the sun (make the sun go around in a circle)," while "goaround the sun" wouldbe "sike suno." The guideline in the Lessons says that the object in theEnglish is not affectedby the action and so is not strictly an object (does not take "e"), but thereseem to be othercases where this guide does not apply. I am regularly uncertain whether to use"e" or not andhave been, I think, inconsistent about it (though never called on either usage).
