A patient experiencesthe state or action, whereas a focus does not.Are you suggesting that only a "patient" can be a direct object andthat a "focus" should not? What about these examples?:"I see you.""I miss you.""I hear you.""I understand you."Compare "mi lukin e sina" with "mi lukin tawa sina". Do I think I'mdoing something to you by looking at you? or do I simply think thatI'm doing some looking in your direction?How I say it just depends how I'm thinking about it.jan Wiko
