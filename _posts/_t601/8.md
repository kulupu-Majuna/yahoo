> So "mi tawa tomo" should mean "I move buildingly" and "I go home should be "mitawa e tomo"?The word "building" in your example is deceptive."mi tawa tomo" means "I am going house-ly" (or "room-ly") which onlymakes sense in the normally accepted interpretation as "I'm going to ahouse/room."If I really were "going buildingly" as you say, setting off on ajourney to build whatever, I might say, "mi tawa pali". which turnsout to make perfect sense.Having a direct object automatically means that the verb istransitive. Thus "tawa" instead of meaning "am-going" it must mean"am-causing-x-to-go". So "mi tawa e tomo" would mean "I am moving thehouse."jan Wiko
