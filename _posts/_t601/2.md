"li sike e suno" == "circle the sun"It's an action performed upon the sun.I find this a very poor explanation, as the sun is not affected by the "action" and thus nothing is "performed upon" it.I believe that "sun" here is a focus, not a patient. Â A patient experiences the state or action, whereas a focus does not.jan Setepo / stevo
