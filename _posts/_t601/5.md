>> I find this a very poor explanation, as the sun is not affected by the "action" and thus nothing is "performed upon" it.
>> I believe that "sun" here is a focus, not a patient.  A patient experiences the state or action, whereas a focus does not.Are you suggesting that only a "patient" can be a direct object andthat a "focus" should not?  What about these examples?:"I see you.""I miss you.""I hear you.""I understand you."Compare "mi lukin e sina" with "mi lukin tawa sina".  Do I think I'mdoing something to you by looking at you? or do I simply think thatI'm doing some looking in your direction?How I say it just depends how I'm thinking about it.jan WikoNo, I'm saying it shouldn't be described as "performing upon" it.jan Setepo / stevo
