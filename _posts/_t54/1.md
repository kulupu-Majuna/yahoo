I find that for the "cuteness" factor, the "u" is the cutest vowel ofthem all. "e" is the least cute.However, having the language pretty well in my ear and mouth already,and having worked a bit to make it natural to speak at home with myfiancee, we are both strongly against the changes for our ownlaziness...I'm sure it would take a while to retrain our ears.Perhaps a tri-volic dialect? ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\-WillOn Tue, 2002-07-09 at 11:20, Chuck Smith wrote:
