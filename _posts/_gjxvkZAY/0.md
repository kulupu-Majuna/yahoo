What are your thoughts on what a Toki-Pona-apeaking culture might be  
like? I imagine they would live in a desert, with a lifestyle somewhat  
like the Kalahari bush tribes, because the small vocabulary suggests  
that there aren't a whole lot of things to name. I would also guess  
that it started out as some kind of creole, because of its lack of  
metaphorical language.  
  
Any other ideas?
