tempo sunu pini la mi lukin e toki Tok Pisin li mi kama sona e ni:  
toki ni li sama mute poka toki pona. ijo nanpa wan la toki pona li  
kepeken e nimi "li". kepeken nasin sama la toki Tok Pisin li kepeken e  
nimi "i". mi sona ala e ni: ni li kama tan toki Tok Pisin.  
  
tan ni la nasin pi toki pona li sama poka nasin pi jan Tok Pisin.  
  
I was recently looking at Tok Pisin, and I realized how much toki pona  
is based on it. E.g., the use of a predicate marker ("li" in toki  
pona; "i" in Tok Pisin) after third person, but not after first or  
second person. (I always thought this was clever, but I didn't realize  
it was adopted from Tok Pisin.)  
  
So it would make sense to imagine our "culture" as being more  
island-based, not just because of Tok Pisin, but because of other  
pidgins and creoles of a similar nature.
