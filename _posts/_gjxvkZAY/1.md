It's funny, I imagine something simular, yet opposite of a desert. I  
imagine if toki pona were to have occurred naturally, it would have  
been on an isolated tropical island. Sort of like a desert in the sense  
that it is isolated and such. Then again, I could have just thought  
that sense the language resembles something like Hawai'ian or Japanese.  
Either way, toki pona would have been spoken by a close knit group or  
tribe as you said. And, in fact isn't it spoken by a "small group" at  
the time being? Interesting thought.
