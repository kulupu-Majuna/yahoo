There's no need to think "sike" is apseudopreposition there: The "metaphor" is clear to me also if "sike"is a normal modifier for the verb.Maybe I'm influenced by Spanish. In my language there are threedifferent ways to say "about" in "talk about":1) the preposition "de" (="of")2) the preposition "sobre" (="on" or "over")3) the words "acerca de" (="at-near of")"acerca" is an arcaic adverb that comes from the latin "adcirca" (="at near"); in the present, "cerca" (near) is used, and"acerca" only remains in the expression I said before.So I see a relation beetwen "about", "near", "around"... and "circle".jan Mako--
