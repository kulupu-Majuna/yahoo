ali o, toki!  
I'm not very happy with this additional use of pi (followed by one word only). IMHO it would be better to extend the meaning of "mi, sina, ona" to include the possessive: tomo tawa ni li mi = This is my car. I'm sure that nobody would understand it as "This car is me" because this doesn't make any sense.

Another use  
pi has one other use. I have decided to describe this use in a  
separate section because it somewhat breaks the rules that you learned  
above. Consider the following sentences:  
kili ni li pi mi. -- This fruit is mine.  
tomo ni li pi jan Tami. -- That house is Tommy's.  
Although it may look a little odd, a pi phrase can be used after li to  
tell who owns something. Here are some more examples if you need to  
look at them:  
ilo ni li pi sina. -- This tool is yours.  
ma ni li pi jan Tosi. -- This land is the Germans'.  
toki ni li pi mi mute. -- This language is ours.
