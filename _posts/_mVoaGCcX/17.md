Another use  
pi has one other use. I have decided to describe this use in a  
separate section because it somewhat breaks the rules that you learned  
above. Consider the following sentences:  
kili ni li pi mi. -- This fruit is mine.  
tomo ni li pi jan Tami. -- That house is Tommy's.  
Although it may look a little odd, a pi phrase can be used after li to  
tell who owns something. Here are some more examples if you need to  
look at them:  
ilo ni li pi sina. -- This tool is yours.  
ma ni li pi jan Tosi. -- This land is the Germans'.  
toki ni li pi mi mute. -- This language is ours.
