I think you can't start the sentence after "ni:" with "li" without a preceding subject. You might say: mi pilin e ni: ijo sona li ijo toki kin. Matthew Martin <[matt@suburbandestiny.com](mailto://matt@suburbandestiny.com)\
> schrieb: mi pilin e ni: li sona la li toki.  I think that if it can be thought, it can be said.   "Do this!" means, I want you to do this, I want it done now, this is not optional, I don't think you have an expectation of negotiation.   o pali!   Please do this?means, I want you to do this, but it is open to debate, I'm expecting resistance, I'm expecting you'll do this because I'm such a nice person, etc. (?) Pona.  o pali!  (looks grammatical, not sure it it expresses what I mean)   Do you want to do this?  I'm not even ordering you to do this, I'm just curious. mi wili sona e ni: wile ala wile pali.  
>>> mi wile sona e ni: sina wile ala wile pali e ni.   Can you do this? I have no doubt you are capable of doing it, but I want you to do it. sina la ken pali e ni?  This is toki pona is a question of abilitity. Without a cultural context, it doesn't mean what the English sentence "Can you do this?" means. 
>>> sina la won't work. Use the "wile ala wile" phrase above. o nasin sina li pona!  Happy trails! 
>>> o precedesan imperative, i.e. a verb, so maybe it's nasin sina li o pona! jan Elumutu    jan Matthew Martin   On 9/27/07, [MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com) <[MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com)

 For "please", I can't figureout where to put the "pona" Why use "pona" at all? How about this?  please = o wile pali! jan Setepo / stevo Heute schon einen Blick in die Zukunft von E-Mails wagen? Versuchen Sie´s mit dem neuen Yahoo! Mail.
