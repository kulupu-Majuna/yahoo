mi pilin e ni: li sona la li toki.  I think that if it can be thought, it can be said. "Do this!" means, I want you to do this, I want it done now, this is not optional, I don't think you have an expectation of negotiation. o pali! Please do this? means, I want you to do this, but it is open to debate, I'm expecting resistance, I'm expecting you'll do this because I'm such a nice person, etc.(?) Pona.  o pali!  (looks grammatical, not sure it it expresses what I mean) Do you want to do this?  I'm not even ordering you to do this, I'm just curious.mi wili sona e ni: wile ala wile pali.   Can you do this? I have no doubt you are capable of doing it, but I want you to do it.sina la ken pali e ni?  This is toki pona is a question of abilitity. Without a cultural context, it doesn't mean what the English sentence "Can you do this?" means. o nasin sina li pona!  Happy trails! jan Matthew Martin On 9/27/07, [MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com) <[MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com)\

 For "please", I can't figure out where to put the "pona" Why use "pona" at all? How about this?  please = o wile pali! jan Setepo / stevo
