i say 'mi wile toki kepeken toki pona' other people say 'mi wile toki lon toki pona'i really don't like this method. but it's acceptable. there's no great difference in what each of these phrases is intended to mean. i just think that using kepeken makes more logical sense. pijeDo you Yahoo!?Yahoo!
