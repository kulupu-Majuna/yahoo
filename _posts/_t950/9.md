If you treat it one way, you won't beable to interpret it the other way.Semantically though, treating "pi" as a sub-modifier requires morecomplexity and a back-and-forth sort of motion to interpret. Treating"pi" as a separator is straightforward and doesn't requirebacktracking.If you think you need more than one "pi" in a phrase, you probablyshould break it up anyway.
