"pretty little girls' school"lon toki pona la, mi toki e ni:"tomo sona pi meli lili pi lukin pona" anu "tomo sona lili pi lukinpona pi meli lili"<< The original English phrase is ambiguous, and so is the first tp phrase. In the second phrase, you have added a "lili" which means that the school as well as the girls are little which is more than what the English phrase says. As I'm not a native speaker of English, I'm not sure whether a school can be "pretty" at all but I feel it cannot.Schools can be pretty, although they aren't usually described that way.  This is a classic sentence for ambiguity, and one of the worst, because "pretty" is polysemous, meaning either "pleasant to look at" or just "rather, very".  In fact, "pretty pretty" can be used, but since it sounds silly, it's not used much.jan Setepo / stevo
