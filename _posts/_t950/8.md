The word "pi" requires the listener to hold the beginning of thephrase in memory until the sub-phrase following "pi" is interpreted.If we allow "pi" to create sub-sub phrases, then teh listener isrequired to keep another concept in memory for every "pi". That'sadded complexity. "ike".I think the simplest solution is to say that "pi" also \*closes\* theinterpretation of the preceding part of the phrase (including anyprior "pi"-sequence). Consider "pi" as a \*separator\*. This way, nomatter how many "pi"-sequences are strung together only \*one\* thingmust be held in memory at a time.So "A pi B C pi D E" would be "(A pi B C) pi D E".jan Wiko
