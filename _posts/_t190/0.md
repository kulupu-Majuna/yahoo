Incoming newbie!I've been studying Toki Pona for a few days now and, with a littleeffort, I can piece together a rudimentary sentence or two. I'malready pretty fluent in Esperanto, so I've had past experience withoversimplified conlangs :)So... that's it, I guess. Nice to meet y'all.mi tawa,jan Meteo
