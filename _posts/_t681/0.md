As a preposition, "tawa," for example, is followed by a noun phrase, its(prepositional)object:"suno li pana tawa tomo mi" "Sun shines on my home." As averb, "tawa"keeps this feature, with a nominal complement separate from any direct objectand unmarked: "janli tawa tomo ona" "A person goes home." Suppose then that we have a modifieron "tawa," forexample that "tawa noka" means "walk" and we want to specify the manner of hisgoing: "jan li tawanoka..." what goes into "...": "tomo ona" ("tawa noka" is a prepositional verblike "tawa" --
though more complex --
 and so takes a new grouping unit) or "pi tomo ona" (thecomplement is stillthere but is a part of the modification started by "noka" only with a new rightgrouping") or"tawa tomo ona" (all the prepositional force is lost and so a new preposition isneeded introducethe goal)? And, if the decsion in this case is the first option, does extend toa more complexunit, say "tawa noka wawa" (or "tawa wawa noka") "run"?
