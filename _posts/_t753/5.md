>> jan Setepo / stevoI'm not saying that dogs and mice don't have nails but really...I'm trying to picture violent mouse claws, without laughing.Just give it up.  Jeez.I like "soweli pi linja uta" for 'cat', since cats are known for their whiskers, while dogs and mice and other animals aren't.  The claws would be a good way to distinguish them too.The point is to use a noticeable characteristic, not necessarily a unique one.  Most mammals have all the same body features, so pick a well-known feature or behavior trait (maybe even color) to identify them.  Usually, though, "soweli" or "soweli lili/suli" will do.jan Setepo / stevo
