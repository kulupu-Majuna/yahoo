Hello,I've only been looking at this language for a couple of days. As I'mcompletely new to this (or any languages other than English) andhaven't had a chance yet to look back over the postings in this group,please forgive me if this has been discussed before.Are there any intentions to expand the official dictionary? I can'tsee how you could distinguish between cats and dogs (or, indeed, otheranimals)?Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to represent autumn and spring.Lastly, has anyone put any audio samples together to aid inpronunciation? I think I've got it, although there appears to be someambiguity in the vowel "a"; even Sonja in her Canadian radio interviewseems to pronounce it differently in different words ("jan" and"pona"). I've gone for the "ahh" sound as I would pronounce "father"in England or Australia. Perhaps it is different in, for example, theUS (cf: "rather").
