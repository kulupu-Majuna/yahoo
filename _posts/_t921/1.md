pona!
>Are there any intentions to expand the official dictionary?Sonja has said there will be 120 words, we currently have 119. Thenewest one was pan, "cereal/grain"John Clifford has informally compiled a dictionary of "idioms/compoundwords/word phrases" which has 3000 entries. I was working on slicingand dicing this to put it in the online dictionary I run, but haven'tbeen able to find a large enough block of time.
>I can't see how you could distinguish between cats and dogs (or,indeed, other animals)?Lots of ways to do it:simplicity: soweligeneral category: soweli tomo \[domesticated animal\]talk until it's clear: .... \[example omitted for brevity\]....idiom: soweli pi linja uta (animal of the lined face, i.e. cat)Blood has been shed arguing what is the better or more tokiponian wayof expressing cat or dog.
>Autumn"tenpo pi lete lili" is one way. The nice thing about toki pona isthat the rules of the language do not stop you from coining a newphrase, which is the whole point."monsi pi tenpo lete", "the rear of winter" is another possibilitythat I just made up. This uses the metaphor of "future is forward",which some may argue is too culturally specific to be used in tokipona.
> Lastly, has anyone put any audio samples together to aid in pronunciation?No, but to the extent that toki pona is defined by IPA phonetics, youcan check out sites that have sound files for all IPA soundshttp://[http://www.ling.hf.ntnu.no/ipa/full/](http://www.ling.hf.ntnu.no/ipa/full/) This may not be the best suchsite, but these sites are very handy for conlang'ing in general.Because of the way Sonja chose the letters, you can make enormousshifts in pronunciation and will still likely to be intelligible.Personally, I've recorded some BYKI (before you know it flash cards)sound files in my heavy american english accent that I hope uploadthem to net someday.mi tawa,jan Matthew MartinOn Dec 2, 2007 12:29 PM, cbnewham <[cbnewham@yahoo.co.uk](mailto://cbnewham@yahoo.co.uk)\
