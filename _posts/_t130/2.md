Many people (me e.g.) don't have the time or time zone to participatein IRCing. For these it would be advantageous to have some quantity ofliterature (I at least use that concept for learning languages:1. learn grammar and basic vocabulary, 2. read loads of stuff,3. start speaking). Since we don't have enough Toki Pona writers, I'dpropose using the chat room for literature generation, i.e. we shouldlog the channel and make it available via web.Therefore two questions:- Who is against logging the channel (e.g. for privacy reasons)?- Who has experience in logging IRC channels?Sina,DniQ.
