Is toki pona dead?This group has been quiet for ages.The IRC channel is empty save for me and Pije.No new people seem to come here.Marraskuu (Sonja) is completely absent.The lessons on tokipona.org are completely wrong, and have been likethat for a year.Toki pona as spoken on IRC is slowly evolving, branching intoPije-Lamentian dialect.ken la tenpo pimeja pi toki pona li lon? jan pona o toki!
