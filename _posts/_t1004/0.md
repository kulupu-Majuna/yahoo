My website (including information on gj√¢-zym-byn, Toki Pona,and various other conlangs, and on the Esperanto Societyfor Metro Atlanta) will be down for some time tomorrow asI transfer my personal web page contents (hopefully withthe same URL) from one residential DSL/phone line accountto another. If all goes well and AT&T is telling me correctly,it will only be for a short time, but I suspect it may be somehours and if something goes wrong, it may be days.The conlang sections of my pages (excluding Esperantoinformation) are mirrored athttp://archives.conlang.info/attic/If you have bookmarks, or especially if you have linksin your own website, to any URL beginning:[http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/i/jimhenry1973/now](http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/i/jimhenry1973/now) would be a good time to change them to usethe permanent URL, starting:[http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/Currently](http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/Currently) the [http://www.pobox.com](http://www.pobox.com) URL redirects to thebellsouthpwp.net URL, and it will probably do soafter tomorrow, but if I am informed incorrectly andI wind up not being able to use the same URLon the new phone account promptly after cancellingthe old one, I may take the opportunity to switchto some other webhosting service, perhapsgooglepages. Feel free to email me with suggestionsabout free and low-cost webhosting services.In any case [http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/will](http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/will), once the site is back up whether atthe bellsouthpwp or some other host, redirectto the actual current address.--
