These are presently handled by two sentences: "A is Ber than C" is "A li Bmute.C li B lili" Andthis creates a small problem since neiother A nor B need be actually B mute or Blili. A moredirect form would be nice. There are two possibilities within the presentsystem: a prepositionmeaning "-er than" or a transitive verb meaing "is -er than" with the propertygoing into thecomplement place. As for vocabulary, "mute" seems to be the obvious choicesemantically. It hasno propositional use at the moment, so it could be extended without cost: "A liB mute C" (the useof "mute" as an intensifier follows in the familiar way from this use: "-er thanusual" or somesuch). There is already a use for transitive "mute," the regular "makesmany/much, augment,increase, nourish." But, like all thses regular vts, this is a doublet for a"kama" form, "kamamute" so the transitive form could be freed up at little cost (and I think thecomparatives aremore common than all the various present meanings taken together): "A li mute Be C." Of course,we can almost get the prepositional form out of this: "A li B pi mute C" thoughwith a differentgrammatical explanation.sina pilin e seme.
