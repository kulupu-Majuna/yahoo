These are presently handled by two sentences: "A is Ber than C" is "A li B mute.C li B lili"  Andthis creates a small problem since neiother A nor B need be actually B mute or B lili. A moredirect form would be nice.  There are two possibilities within the present system: a prepositionmeaning "-er than"  or a transitive verb meaing "is -er than" with the property going into thecomplement place.  As for vocabulary, "mute" seems to be the obvious choice semantically.  It hasno propositional use at the moment, so it could be extended without cost: "A li B mute C" (the useof "mute" as an intensifier follows in the familiar way from this use: "-er than usual" or somesuch).  There is already a use for transitive "mute," the regular "makes many/much, augment,increase, nourish."  But, like all thses regular vts, this is a doublet for a "kama" form, "kamamute" so the transitive form could be freed up at little cost (and I think the comparatives aremore common than all the various present meanings taken together): "A li mute B e C."  Of course,we can almost get the prepositional form out of this: "A li B pi mute C" though with a differentgrammatical explanation.sina pilin e seme.ni li pona tawa mi.jan Setepo / stevo
