>Of course, I would argue that using "mute" as a preposition IS staying withinthe system, since itis just realizing an unactualized potential. On the other hand, "poka" alreadyis a preposition,so that all this move requires is an extention of its meaning. I personallydon't see comaprisonas a lot like accompaniment, but, if we go back to "side," the notion of puttingtwo things sideby side does make the conection. I can't think of a clear case where what arefor us two meaningsof "poka" would conflict. I still prefer "mute" at the moment but I can seemore alternativesthan I did before.
