It is still not clear why the 'o.'adverbial phrases are phrases(!) which, as an adverb, have influenceon the whole phrase it belongs to. it's the only way to explain why'la' can have time modifiers as well as conditional phrases (or youshould tell me an other catch-all way to see it) and it gives you agreat deal of liberty in expression.--
