I've changed P7 to allow phrases like "monsi lupa laso jelo pi wan ante pi insa pi kulupu pi kasi suli". Â In other words, I'm interpreting the rule that more than one word must follow "pi" to include other "pi"-phrases.P7 <Noun-Phrase
> ::= <Noun
> \[<Modifier
>\*\] | <Noun-Phrase
> "pi" < Noun-Phrase
