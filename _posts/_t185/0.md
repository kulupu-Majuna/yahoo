For the next few days, there will be translation of Dr. Seuss's 'Howthe Grinch Stole Christmas' on the site.[http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/grinch/index.htmlLike](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/grinch/index.htmlLike) for the Halloween book, there is a little English translation atthe bottom of each page.When I put the Halloween book up last time, I discovered that thebandwidth limit that Geocities gives me (about 4 megabytes per hour)had been maxed out. So if you can't get onto the site, try back whenthe next hour begins.jan Pije
