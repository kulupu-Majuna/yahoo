>> Eh? Advogato isn't invitation-only.[http://www.advogato.org/certs.htmljan](http://www.advogato.org/certs.htmljan) sin pi lipu Advogato.org li ken sitelen e kama pi tenpo sunotaso. taso jan ante li lukin e ni li ken pana e ken kama tawajan sin. ken pana ni li "certifications" lon lipu ni.ante la jan pi selo pi lipu Orkut.com li ken ala toki pi wilee ni: jan ante li ken pana e ken kama tawa ona.(A new Advogato.org user can write only diaries, but otherpeople read them and may grant invitations to new users.The site calls such invitations "certifications."On the other hand, a person outside of Orkut.com can't askothers to grant him an invitation.)
