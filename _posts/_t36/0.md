I would like to add words for Hinduism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism to:
http://www.tokipona.org/foreign.php#nasinsewi

Does anybody know what are the original words used in the language of these religions? I would like to tokiponize the names directly from the source pronunciation.

Are there any other major religions I need to add? Maybe animism/voodoo.
