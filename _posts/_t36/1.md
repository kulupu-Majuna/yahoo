\> I would like to add words for Hinduism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism to:\> http://www.tokipona.org/foreign.php#nasinsewi

I don't know off-hand what the languages of the religious texts call
the religions, but here's a start:

Hinduism is \<Sanatana Dharma\>, the Eternal Religion.
[http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Hinduism](https://web.archive.org/web/20020208172440/http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Hinduism)
[http://www.hindubooks.org/wehwk/](https://web.archive.org/web/20020208122950/http://www.hindubooks.org/wehwk/)

Jainism comes from the Sanskrit word for saint \<jinah\>
[http://www.crystalinks.com/jainism.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20020210101210/http://crystalinks.com/jainism.html)
unfortunately, \<jinah\> is a false friend to TP \<sina\>.

Zoroastrianism was founded by Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) in Persia
around 1,000 BCE ... In India, Zoroastrians are known as Parsis
[http://http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoroastrianism&oldid=93679)

> Are there any other major religions I need to add?

Let's see... you already have the religion that worships Mammon.
\<nasin mani\> = "capitalism"

> Maybe animism/voodoo.

Animism comes from the Latin \<anima\> = "soul".
[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01526a.htm])

Voodoo is really Vodun.
[http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Vodun](https://web.archive.org/web/20030701213503/http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodun)

Toki Pona \<pona\> = "good". Samoan \<pona\> = "faulty". Who's right?
