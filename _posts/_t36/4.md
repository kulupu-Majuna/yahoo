Krishna is the only God. There is no other God. He has a lot of names.

There are same demigods, you can mean as gods, but they are not.

I very recommend books "Bhagavad-gita, as it is", "Srimad-Bhagavatam" or any other Veda's text translated and explained by
Srila Prabhupada. It is giving the meaning of life.

May be, there are more than one hinduism.

Just my knowing... :-)
