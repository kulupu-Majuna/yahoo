Krishna is the only God. There is no other God. He has a lot of names.There are same demigods, you can mean as gods, but they are not.I very recommend books "Bhagavad-gita, as it is", "Srimad-Bhagavatam" or any other Veda's text translated and explained bySrila Prabhupada. It is giving the meaning of life.May be, there are more than one hinduism.Just my knowing... :-)TomasOn 31 May 2002 at 6:33, vixcafe wrote:
