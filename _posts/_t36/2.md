ad hinduism: 

God's name is Krishna (Kr.s.n.a /dot should be under followed letter/)

They say that Krishna is the only God. It is the same God for other religions,
but the way of
bhakti-yoga is the best way of serving to Krishna. Try to sing: 'Hare Krishna
Hare Krishna Krishna
Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare' and you will see God.
It is the
same like you call someone's name if want him wake up (from sleeping). You sing
this maha mantra
to wake up God in you. Krishna has many names by his actions or incarnations: Rama, Govinda,
Chaitanya, ... 

IMHO there in the word for this religion should be name Krishna, because it is
the right word. It is hard to "convert" words from sanskrit to TP because sanskirt has near 3
times more
letters than TP :-) Please see [http://www.iskcon.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20020605193306/http://iskcon.org/). ISKCON is an international organization founded in
sixties by
Shrila Prabhupada. Prabhupada is one of the best people I know about. To choose
the right word for
hinduism you should know its ideas. Hare Krishna! Tomas 'klip' Klapka
