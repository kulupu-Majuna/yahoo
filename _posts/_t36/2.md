ad hinduism: God's name is Krishna (Kr.s.n.a /dot should be under followed letter/) They say that Krishna is the only God. It is the same God for other religions,but the way ofbhakti-yoga is the best way of serving to Krishna. Try to sing: 'Hare KrishnaHare Krishna KrishnaKrishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare' and you will see God.It is thesame like you call someone's name if want him wake up (from sleeping). You singthis maha mantrato wake up God in you. Krishna has many names by his actions or incarnations: Rama, Govinda,Chaitanya, ... IMHO there in the word for this religion should be name Krishna, because it isthe right word. It is hard to "convert" words from sanskrit to TP because sanskirt has near 3times moreletters than TP ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") Please see [http://www.iskcon.org](http://www.iskcon.org). ISKCON is an international organization founded insixties byShrila Prabhupada. Prabhupada is one of the best people I know about. To choosethe right word forhinduism you should know its ideas.
