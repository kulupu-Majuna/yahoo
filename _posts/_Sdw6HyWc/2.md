Yet I think somebody made a stab at it a while ago. Other shots would be welcome, even though the notions involved are mainly not appropriate for ma pona. The word used then for 'rights' was, I think, 'nasin lawa,' which works in certain contexts certainly. But rights in this sense are mainly prohibitions on others, so something like 'ken ala' might be involved or 'wile' in some complex.

I'd be very surprised if TP turned out to be suitable for translating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
  
I much prefer the Esperanto version:  
  
Cxiuj homoj estas denaske liberaj kaj egalaj la√π digno kaj rajtoj.
