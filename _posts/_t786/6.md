Assetepo points out, there are a lot of names for it here, some regional, some for slightly (orgreatly) different versions of the same basic idea but for special purposes; case knife, Barlowknife, switchblade and sling blade, even shiv, though that is getting pretty far away in terms ofstyle and purpose.  These all describe different knives to me.  stevo / jan Setepo
