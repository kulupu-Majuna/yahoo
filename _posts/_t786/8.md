Assetepo points out, there are a lot of names for it here, some regional, some forslightly (orgreatly) different versions of the same basic idea but for special purposes;case knife, Barlowknife, switchblade and sling blade, even shiv, though that is getting pretty faraway in terms ofstyle and purpose.
