The original of this one is from the XVIth century. It's a humor "poem song".\[By the way, is it right "XVIth century" or "XVI century" or both?\]The ordinal number is appropriate here, so the "th" ending is much better.  I personally prefer "16th" or "sixteenth" to "XVIth".  In German, it's possible to use a period after a number to denote the ordinal (16. Jahrhundert), but I have never seen that done in English.jan Setepo / stevo
