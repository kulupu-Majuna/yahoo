I am building a civilization

And thinking of their language structure.

Tokipona seemed ideal at first.

But tall person and important person is one and the same thing

So what if there is a TALL PERSON and there is a much respected
important person in this community?

How would we differentiate?
Would tokipona end up creating compound - that would increase
complexity

Very curious here
