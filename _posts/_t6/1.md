Well, Toki Pona is a context-driven language. It enables us to focus on
the now and connect speaker with listeners in a more intimate manner.
So depending on the specific context of the utterance, you could use
anything except "suli" to distinguish them, such as perhaps their names: \
jan So Joe \
jan Enli Henri
