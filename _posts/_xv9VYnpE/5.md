jan David o, toki!  
One of the many nice features of toki pona is the variety of "allowed" forms of pronounciation. In short: tay-loh or teh-low or even deh-lo and the like for "telo" are all fully correct. The main things to observe are the stress on the first syllable and not to pronounce "u" as in "music", "i" not as in "ivory" and "a" not as in "alien". There is no need to bother about aspirating or not aspirating t, p, and k - you're free to do it or not, as you like.

Hi, I just 'discovered' TP last week. I have memorized 30 vocabulary  
words so far and completed the lessons on basic sentence structure,  
direct objects and adjectives. I am confused at how the vowel e is  
pronounced. Is telo pronounced tehlo or taylo? Is wile pronounced  
weeleh or weelay? How is the e which introduces the direct object  
pronounced, eh or ay?  
  
I am looking forward to the day when I can post to this group in both  
TP and English. Hopefully it won't be very long.  
  
Thanks in advance for your help.
