Hi, I just 'discovered' TP last week. I have memorized 30 vocabulary  
words so far and completed the lessons on basic sentence structure,  
direct objects and adjectives. I am confused at how the vowel e is  
pronounced. Is telo pronounced tehlo or taylo? Is wile pronounced  
weeleh or weelay? How is the e which introduces the direct object  
pronounced, eh or ay?  
  
I am looking forward to the day when I can post to this group in both  
TP and English. Hopefully it won't be very long.  
  
Thanks in advance for your help.
