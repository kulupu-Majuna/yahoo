Hi, everyone! I'm still taking Pije's lessons (yes, I'm quite  
slow...), and having doubts.  
  
In lesson four, the given translation of "Pineapple is a food and is  
good" is "kili li moku li pona". I couldn't understand why it  
shouldn't be "kili e moku e pona" instead. In this case, "moku" and  
"pona" mean "to be a food" and "to be good"?  
  
Please help me. Thanks a lot.
