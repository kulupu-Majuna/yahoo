I think that:ijo li ike tawa sina la o pali ala e ike ni tawa jan ante.If something is bad for you, don't do this bad to others."If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, Iwill accept it.""Se oni Min ofras ame kaj adoreme folion, floron, frukton au' akvon, Mi akceptosg'in.""jan li pana olin e kasi anu kasi kule anu kili anu telo tawa mi la mi kama jo eona."Bhagavad Gita 9.26tan lipu toki sewi Kita 9.26 On Fri, Apr 3, 2009 at 5:09 PM, Sai Emrys <saizai@gmail. com

I said at LCC3I'd do the Shema in Esperanto and Toki Pona as well as gzb; here'sHillel's version of the Golden rule in those languages:Tion, kio malagrablas al vi, ne faru al via proksimulo.pali ijo li ike tawa sina. o pali ala e ni tawa jan ante!(I'm open to suggestions from other Esperanto or Toki Ponaspeakers on the list about improving those. In particular,I wonder if "aliulo" or "kunulo" might be more apt than"proksimulo" (I chose the latter because it's used in relatedcontexts in the Esperanto translation of the Bible, e.g.the parable of the Good Samaritan), and whether thetwo sentences in my Toki Pona version might should/ could be joined into one with "la". I'm disinclined todo so because of the length of the first clause.)--
