Sure, I can explain it:  
  
I have no personal quarrel with any of you. I'm just unhappy with  
this platform (the Toki Pona Yahoo Group) because it seems cumbersome  
and inconvenient to me.  
  
One big inconvenience is that any post has to be approved by an  
administrator before it becomes visible to the group. This seems  
inconvenience to me because I frequently write in several other  
internet forums, and none of them is run in such a restrictive mode.  
Usually, in any forum, posts are immediately published when sent. But  
in this group, once a harmless little post of me was automatically  
rejected because noone approved it within 7 days. I suppose this  
happend by an oversight, but it was pretty annoying to me.  
  
And there are further inconveniences here, too: You people are nice,  
but all in all this Yahoo Group user interface seems awkward to me. I  
wish we'd all relocate to a modern style forum like "Simple Machines  
Forum" or something similar.
