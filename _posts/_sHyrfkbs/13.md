Dear Sven,  
  
I'm sorry for this inconvenience. The settings are: "First message  
moderated, then not any more" but Yahoo makes it harder than necesary... Now  
your messages are not moderated any more before posted. I'm terribly sorry  
it took me so long to switch the moderation off for you :'(. (It's a bit  
hidden in the member settings, so it's a les trivial task than I would like  
it.)  
  
And yes, I'm responsible for the mere fact that the stuff is moderated this  
way. Upon request of members because of spam (which I still have to pick out  
quite a lot...) I became moderator and set up this policy. I even got a  
helping moderator (Marek//jan Male) in case I'm not there, but the both of  
us don't have loads of time on hands.  
  
So, yet another time sorry, and I hope this solves it for now.
