tenpo pini la mi musi ala. tenpo pini ni la mi pali e toki musikepeken toki pona. pilin sina mute li seme.(In the past I was bored. In that time, I created a poem using TP.What are your thoughts?)tenpo ni (tan jan Ke)mi lon. mi lon ala. mi ike li pona.mi pimeja li suno; mi telo li ma.mi pali li moli. mi ale li ala.mi sona e ale. mi ale lon sina.toki musi ni li jo e toki mute. There are different shades ofmeaning, and different translations, since the equative verb doesn'texist to distinguish. Not only that, but the different meanings ofthe words add to that depth, and it applies to my different beliefson the higher power, jan sewi. musi pona!
