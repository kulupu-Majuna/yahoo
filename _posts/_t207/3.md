> I know everything. I'm always with you.jan Pije, Actually, I think you're right; it would make more sense toreplace it with a period instead of a semi-colon. I must have notbeen thinking at the time!jan Goren, Thanks for translating my poem. You got it, though the 'mynoun,' I thought that would be 'noun mi'.. Eh. Here are my othertranslations for comparison :)Now, by KeI ame here. I am not here. I am the evil, and goodness.I am the darkness and the light. I am water and the earth.I am creation and death. I am everything and nothing.I know all things/life/everything. I am everything/life/all in you.I exist. I do not exist. I am bad and good.I darken and light. I water and am earth.I create and kill. I live and am nothing.I know all. I live in you.I wonder if ale can be used to mean, 'live' as well...
