Interesting poem. It reminds of me the (somewhat antagonizing) contrasts in the opening of Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way..." Why in the second line did you use a semi-colon to separate the two sentences while in the other three you used a period? I don't see much remarkable reason to join them that way. PijeDo you Yahoo!?Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo! HotJobs
