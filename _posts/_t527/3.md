I totally agree. All other languages are encyclopedicor try to be. The specificity of Tokipona is to becontext-related, so it just needs a limited number ofwords. Et ça, c'est simplement génial!But when I tell a story on Internet, I do not know thecontext in which lives the reader. Furthermore, theopposition between the notions "cat" and "dog" had tobe displayed in the story. So I had to look for asolution which really works ...I have found a victim here in Strasburg, who agrees tolearn Tokipona and to talk with me in "real life"conditions (so we will be in the same context). I amanxious to see if it really works ...I will tell you !François (jan Kanso)---
