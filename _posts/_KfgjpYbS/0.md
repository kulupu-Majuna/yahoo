Hello! (First post.) I'm a newcomer to Toki Pona; I still have a lot to learn.  
Despite that, my studying Japanese and Japanese honorifics has made me wonder...  
Would any want to come up with a set of Toki Pona honorifics?  
It wouldn't need to be made official, just something for fun,  
and also because jan is rather repetitive.
