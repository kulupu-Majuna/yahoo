Mat-Eo and I are the two most fluent speakers. We have entire functional conversations in TP.
I am sure we could record something at some point... :)

Note that a lot of the TP language has been developed beyond the few simple lessons that have been presented on the site. I don't have the time to document everything yet, but I have been personally teaching the extra unwritten "lessons" via our IRC chat room to those who have wanted to become more fluent.

I would say, for example, that Lament is the 3rd most fluent TP chatter.
