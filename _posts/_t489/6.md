> Dear Dan,
>> Thank you for your interest in the ISO/DIS 639-3 Codes for the
> representation of names of languages - part 3. Since the ISO/DIS 639-3 is
> still awaiting final vote as it currently stands, we are not making any
> additions or changes at present. After the final vote has occurred, we
> will post information about the process by which the public may propose
> changes and how they will be reviewed for inclusion in the 639-3
> standard.
> I will be glad to send you a notice of that posting when it occurs.
>> Because your proposal is with regard to a constructed language, it may be
> that LinguistList (the original source of the ancient, historical and
> constructed languages in ISO/DIS 639-3) is a part of the proposal review
> process, but at this time, I do not know. You may wish to write to them
