I try to avoid discussions of "how do you say "X" in toki pona?" completely out of context. I know how comforting it is to have a complete lexicon with fixed phrases for every possible concept we can think of - and I agree that having some standard and immediately recognisable phrases for commonly used concepts(even out of context) is probably useful - but creating such a dictionary is not in the way of toki pona as I see it.  
  
For the particular phrase in quesion here, I think it is possible, even likely, that we would be about an editor in chief after having put the paper/magazine s/he is working for in context. If this is case, simply "jan pali" (or "jan lawa" for editor in chief) is sufficient to convey the intended meaning. If the context isn't there... it might be helpful to establish it.  
  
e.g. "my father is editor in chief of the Sunday Times" = "mama mi li jan lawa lon lipu "Sunday Times"." (I assume the gender of the father was not relevant in that conversation)  
  
Yes, I know. "Jan lawa" could be the managing director, the owner etc... again I say "context". If there ws any danger that I would be misunderstood, I might go for "jan sitelen lawa" (the head writing man). but, as always, the simpler the better.
