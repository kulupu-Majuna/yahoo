Several of us on the CONLANG mailing list talked recently aboutcollectively picking a conlang with few or no speakers yet, but whichis fully developed enough to be speakable, and learning it together.We've created a new mailing list for this project; we'll discusspossible conlangs to learn for a while, and then decide on one.
