jan Emu o!sina wile toki ike kepeken toki pona tan seme?Why do some people insist on trying to say complicated things intwisted phrases of Toki Pona? It's like writing object-oriented codein assembly language. Yes, I know it's possible... and I know thatBorland \*fired\* the developer who instigated that nonsense.My point is, if you have a complex idea, it's very likely that there'sa simpler core to the way your mind is really handling it. WHOSE FACErepresents the idea to you? WHAT did that person do? Don't try tocram it all into one phrase or one sentence. Tell a story.On 8/3/07, Helmut Voigt <[akesi_palisa@yahoo.de](mailto://akesi_palisa@yahoo.de)\
