Some of us are having trouble with just using the words "soweli" and"akesi" for animals instead of specifying them; every once in a while,a thread about it will pop up.  But I notice this problem never ariseswith "waso" and "kala."  I think this is because birds all have thesame basic shape, as do fish, and so we have a reasonably accuratepicture in our minds when we hear those words.  But if I hear the word"soweli," I don't know what to picture--
is it "soweli pi linja uta"(cat), "soweli jan" (monkey/ape), "soweli pi palisa lawa" (elephant),or something else entirely?  Similarly, if I hear "akesi," I don'tknow what to picture; is it "akesi palisa" (snake), "akesi poki"(turtle), "akesi telo" (frog or other amphibian), or something elseentirely?This is why some of us feel the need to specify what kind of animalsomething is.  If I say "dog," you have a reasonably accurate picture,as all dogs have the same basic shape.  But the word "soweli" doesn'tgive that.Aha!  A Sapir-Whorf effect!  What do you think of when you hear the word "animal"?  It's even less specific than either "soweli" or "akesi".  jan Setepo / stevo
