Some of us are having trouble with just using the words "soweli" and"akesi" for animals instead of specifying them; every once in a while,a thread about it will pop up. But I notice this problem never ariseswith "waso" and "kala." I think this is because birds all have thesame basic shape, as do fish, and so we have a reasonably accuratepicture in our minds when we hear those words. But if I hear the word"soweli," I don't know what to picture--
is it "soweli pi linja uta"(cat), "soweli jan" (monkey/ape), "soweli pi palisa lawa" (elephant),or something else entirely? Similarly, if I hear "akesi," I don'tknow what to picture; is it "akesi palisa" (snake), "akesi poki"(turtle), "akesi telo" (frog or other amphibian), or something elseentirely?This is why some of us feel the need to specify what kind of animalsomething is. If I say "dog," you have a reasonably accurate picture,as all dogs have the same basic shape. But the word "soweli" doesn'tgive that.However, once the animal is specified, I would have no problem withjust "soweli" or "akesi" after that.Example:soweli jan mute li kepeken e ilo sitelen lon lipu. soweli ni li palie sitelen pona.If you just use "soweli" and "akesi," how do you get around theproblem of picturing the animal in question? If you don't, do youhave a list in your mind of each kind of animal?I'd be interested in your various solutions to the problem.jan Sosuwa
