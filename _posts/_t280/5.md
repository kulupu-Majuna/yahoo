>> Um. I don't think that would be usable.Having said that, if you wanted to try, you could have a go atlocalising OpenOffice.org; I know that one volunteer has alreadyapproached the Klingon community and was very enthusiastic aboutlocalising OOo into Klingon. So why not Toki Pona? (If you're preparedto do all the work of translating --
 or find someone who is.)Or for fun, you could localise the Opera browser --
 anyone can createa language file in their favourite language and localise the browserthat way, and I've done so for version 6 in Verdurian, a conlang byMark Rosenfelder.Cheers,--
