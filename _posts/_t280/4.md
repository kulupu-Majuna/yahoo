It's about "the simple things of life".Being vague is built into the language - "pona" means "good" as wellas "simple", for example, and that's (to me) just one example of whatmakes it very easy to utter vague platitudes such as "ale li pona" buthard to differentiate precise shades of meaning.I believe that it may be possible by connecting enough words togetherto shrink the range of possible meanings to what you want to specify,but that would make things so verbose that you would have to read verymuch text, which may not even fit into the screen layout of the officesoftware.How would you say "file", for example? "ijo pi awen ijo" - "thing forkeeping things"?So basically, I think you'd either have to be vague or be verbose. (Oruse tons of foreign words, which kind of undermines the spirit of TokiPona.)Cheers,--
