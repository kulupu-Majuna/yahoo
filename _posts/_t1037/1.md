There going to have another meeting but to make a long story short, Ithink there going to pay for the plane ticket. But I'm having some trouble withmy travel agent (wonderful colored woman, very articulite) who caint find TokiPona on her list. I think its the high schools these days. Anyway is itconsidered its own country, or is it part of some other one like Indonisia?
>> Also what religion are they? (Is it Tayoism?) And is it safe in Toki Pona? Arethey a democracy like us? Whats the weather like over there? I heard it rains alot on the islands. Is there soap? Do they use toilet paper? And what are somegood gifts to bring to native families? My uncle says American blue jeans--
isthat okay? I don't want to bring wisky or rock music. Do you think they wouldlike little angel figurines? Or some childrens books telling them about Jesus.Sorry for asking so many questions but I'm starting to get nervous. Theres somuch I dont know.
>> I'm learning the language right now and with Jesuses help I will soon be on myway, with a suitcase full of Bible tracks (if we can get these translated intime--
there drawn as funnybooks). Of course I still believe that America is thegreatest country in the world, but we all have to help the less fortunite. Godbless.
