I have read Sonja writesomewhere "tan seme la ...?", and it means "why is that ...". Andothers have used this expression in earlier texts too."tan ni" can actually have three meanings. tan can be a preposition,used similarly to the English "because of". mi tawa sike tan pakalanoka. (this language doesn't stop to be hilarious, really.)And I have mistaken an other meaning for a third. It can mean "tanpi ni", the reason of this thing. And it can mean "this reason justmentioned". Now this is what it apparently means preceding thatpesky "la".Anyway.
> "la" just means : "the next word is the subject of the
> verb"This is not true. What you say would allow random compoundsentences. Actually it just declares a context of occurance andstates that the following stuff is within this context. It's notlike you imagine "tan ni:" were at the end of sentence,meaning "because of the following:" and the previous sentence cameafter it. No. "tan ni la" means "and under these circumstances justmentioned".Hehe ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") I hope that sounds at least half as correct as it soundsconfusing.All in all, thanks for your attention, and I think I will use "tanni la" if I need to.jan Siwen---
