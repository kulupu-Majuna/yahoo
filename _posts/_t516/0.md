I have read some earlier posts about 
>>toki lili "tan ni la"<<, andI am not entirely sure that I get it right. My best guess is asfollows.mi pilin ike tan ni: mi kepeken e kasi ike. mi pilin ike tan kasi.I feel sick because I smoke. I feel sick because of the tobaccoplant.mi kepeken e kasi ike. ni li kama e ni: mi pilin ike.I smoke, therefore I feel sick.So I can say it both ways, and say it kinda Tokiponish, right? Butthis one:mi kepeken e kasi ike. tan ni la mi pilin ike.This does not quite mean what most people seem to think it means ifI am getting this right. Literally it means "under the condition ofthe reason of this". It is referring to a common cause, not causalrelationship. So I could just as well saymi pilin ike. tan ni la mi kepeken e kasi ike.and say exactly the same as in the last sentence.As a modifier, "tan ni" means "this as a reason". "Because of this".mi moku tan sina. But when it stands alone, it means "the reason /cause / source of this". Right?
