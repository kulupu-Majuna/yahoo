The jist that I get about toki pona is that it coveys mostly basicideas. However there is this little quirk.jan li moli. --

>A person is dead.A person is dying.A person is killing.A person is death itself.This phrase means all these things at once. Can't we find a way tosort these out.If I may suggest, why don't we just and an 'n' to 'li' and use itwhen the 'to be' is being used, use 'jo' + verb for intransitivemeanings, and 'lin pi' when the predicate is a noun.jan li moli. --

> A person is killing.jan lin moli. --

> A person is dead.jan lin pi moli --

> A person is death.jan li jo moli --

> A person is dying.ormi moli --

> I am killing.mi lin moli --

> I am dead.mi lin pi moli --

> I am death.mi jo moli --

> I am dying.My suggestion is probably no help but I thought I would suggest itanyway.
