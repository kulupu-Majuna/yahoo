I don't really like your suggestion all that much. The ideas seem too complex. But, if you want, send your email to the TP message board or I can forward it there for you.Anyway, here's what I thought about the ideas:------
I think jan li moli is okay.If you need to specify that a person is killing something you can add "e ijo" to the end: jan li moli e ijo."A person is dead" and "A person is dying" aren't really very different. I don't think Toki Ponans would specify in most cases. If you needed to do so, though, you could use a "la" phrase:tenpo kama la jan ni li moli. --
 In the future, this person will be dead. ... So in other words, the person is dying.tenpo ni li jan ni li moli. --
 At this time, this person is dead. ... So in other words, he's dead already."A person is death itself" seems like an odd, abstract concept to me. I don't think Toki Ponans would use something like that.-----
So, in effect, the "lin" and "jo + verb" ideas seem rather unnecessary to me. Nice suggestion, though.mi tawa.jan Pije
