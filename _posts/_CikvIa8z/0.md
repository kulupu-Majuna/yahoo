I know I've been asking all the questions lately, but here's one more  
particular problem I'm having. With embedded statements, we use the  
"ni:" construction:  
  
mi sona e ni: musi Mawijo li pona tawa sina.  
I know you like the Mario games.  
  
But how would I translate a sentence like this:  
  
If I say, "Will you please go now?", will you go?  
  
I know there's a "mi toki e ni:" and a "la" somewhere... how is this  
construction handled?
