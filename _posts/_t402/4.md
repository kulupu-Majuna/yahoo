Many thanks to three of you who have consideredletting me use your space. I really appreciate it!Lypanov, you asked how many hits per day I get. Goodquestion! All of Nytka's stuff is in shambles, and Ican't access my site stats. I can't remember how many.Sorry. Since I don't know how many hits, I'll play onthe safe side to make sure that my site is not ahindrance to you. So I'm more interested inesperanto-jeunes.org and tobareinne.comAxel and Arin, if you allow me to use your space, howdo I upload files? I update the pages semi-frequently,so I'm curious as to how easily it is to make updatesto things.(Axel, mi malbone parolas Esperanton. Mi esperas ke vipovas kompreni anglan. Si vi bezonas, mi povas peniskribi en Eo.)On a more personal note, what is tobareinne.com about?It doesn't seem to have any links and so forth. I knowit's not terribly important to the hosting issue; I'mjust curious as to what it is for.Thanks again to the three of you who have offered toshare space.Pije\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!
