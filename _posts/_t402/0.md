As you might have realized, tokipona.nytka.org has been down for overa week now. Nytka hasn't put up any news as to why this has happened,and they won't respond to my email.I've tried finding a decent free host but to no avail. All of themwant to inundate pages with ads, accept only 100% English sites, havesilly file size limits, or other such hindrances.So I wanted to ask to see if anyone has enough webspace that theycould share so that I can get the site put back online. Right now thesite is 12.5 mb. Over time it tends to increase a little, but very slowly.lipu tokipona.nytka.org li lon ala. kulupu Nytka li toki ala tawa mi.mi wile e ni: lipu mi li kepeken e kulupu ante. taso kulupu ali li ikeli nasa.mi wile e ni: jan ali li ken lukin e lipu mi. sina ken ala ken ponatawa lipu mi?jan Pije
