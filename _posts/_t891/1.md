To make "It doesn't exist in the dict." clearer, I would propose ona li lon ala kin lon nimi ale. So it is clear that the second lon is used as a preposition. "Is it a dictionary" would be ni li (lipu pi) nimi ale anu seme? "He didn't go to the office": ona li tawa ala tomo pali. In the third example, "use" requires an object. jan ElumutuMatthew Martin <[matt@suburbandestiny.com](mailto://matt@suburbandestiny.com)\

>"Is my cat in my house?"Ha! I didn'tnotice that until everyone pointed it out. Here arethree more of the same pattern.ona li lon ala lon nimi ale. It doesn't exist in the dictionary. Itisn't in the dictionary. (Is it a dictionary?)ona li tawa ala tawa tomo pali. He didn't go to the office. (Did he goto the office?)ona li kepeken ala kepeken kon insa. He didn't use with inhalation. (Ok, I cheated, strictly speaking kepeken is transitive and the ephrase would make it unambiguous)mi tawa,jan Matthew Martin Yahoo!
