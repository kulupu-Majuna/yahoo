The point is that "lon" and "tawa" at least are "tawa"-class verbs, verbalizedprepositions as janSonja has said, so they do not need the repetition of the identical prepositionafter them.Your no question forms are just "ona li lon ala nimi ale" "ona li tawa ala tomopali." As younote, "kepeken" is different, being in this case (apparently) a transitive verbor, ifintransitive, meaning something like "he is not useful using a inhalation(?)"---
