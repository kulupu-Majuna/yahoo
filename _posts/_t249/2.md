\*compare/weigh/judge, compari/pezi/jugxiWere you wanting a specific verb to use for judge?There really isn't one, but the idea sometimes can beexpressed in context. Look at this dialogue:jan Pepe: len mi li pona. len sina li ike.Pepe: My shirt is good. Your shirt is bad. \[In otherwords, he's comparing the shirts.\]jan Penelope: o toki ala e ni!Penelope: Don't say that! \[In other words, she'stelling Pepe not to judge the shirts.\]\* heavy, pezaAgain, there's no word for this, but you still canexpress it. Imagine that there is a big rock that isheavy. You might say something like "If you want tomove this stone, you will have to work a lot." (sinawile tawa e kiwen ni la sina wile pali mute.)\* left/right, dekstra/maldekstraThere is no direct way to express this. But, it canstill be done in a round-about way. Try to imaginethat you are a Toki Ponan who lives together withother Toki Ponans. You see them and can talk to themdirectly. Imagine some Toki Pona speakers sittingaround talking together, or walking through nature.Anyhow, if the language were used in this situation,you could use landmarks and natural objects in thearea as a reference. For example, the speaker couldsimply point in the direction he's talking about, andeveryone would understand because they can see him.Therefore, there is no need for the words left andright. Use objects that exist in the area as landmarksto specify left and right. If the speaker wanted totalk about his left hand, he could just say "luka ni"then wave around his left hand a little bit, or pointto it using his right hand.If you've played my translation of Zelda 1, you willdiscover I used this method to describe the secretpath that allows you to escape the forest.\* east/west, orienta/okcidentaUse something like 'ma pi suno kama' for east, becausethe sun arrives from the east.Something like 'ma pi suno weka' could be used forwest.\* In your message, you wrote:
 jan sonja li weka e nimi'pakila'. tenpo ni la jan li toki seme?I think you've made a mistake. There never was a word'pakila' in Toki Pona. What word did you mean? Theword 'pakala' is still in the dictionary; it is a verycommon word.jan Pije\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?New and Improved Yahoo!
