>> Yeah, and maybe we could take away the word "sewi"...I think that could work ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\
> I though that spiritual being is "jan kon"I thought so too when I started, but I realized that 'sewi' refers toanything holy, or high. In one context, it could mean the sky, whileanother could refer to something holy or spiritual. 'kon' is like,air or wind; that tangible invisibility. While kon is tangible andrefers to just air, sewi in intangible and refers to a holy thing...I think ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
