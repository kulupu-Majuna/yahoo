toki! sina mute li pilin seme? mi jo e Website pi toki pona. ni li Twitter pitoki pona. o lukin [http://tokilili.shoutem.com/](http://tokilili.shoutem.com/) .Hello! How are you all? I have made a website that is sort of like Twitter, butfor speakers of Toki Pona, called Toki Lili. Take a look here:[http://tokilili.shoutem.com/](http://tokilili.shoutem.com/) .It's just starting, so there isn't much content at the moment, but it would begreat if you would join and help build the community. And if you already have aTwitter, Facebook, Ping.fm, Twhirl, or Ning account, you can have your Toki Liliposts automatically posted to them.mi tawa,tokipwner or kalama
