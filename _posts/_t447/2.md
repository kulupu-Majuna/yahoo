So pardon my English.I think there are some myths and misconceptions aboutTP:1) "TP is 'primitivist' or 'Taoist'." It is a simple language, but this does not imply or necessarily leadto a simple or primitive lifestyle. jan Sonja wrote Taoist poetry, butyou can write just about anything in TP. What's more, I see nothingTaoist about a language which has "utala", but no simple way to say"peace".2) "TP illustrates the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, because it simplifiesone's thought patterns." Well, rendering "friend" as "jan pona" certainly gives a differentperspective, but I wouldn't say it "simplifies" our thought orworldview. One still has a concept of "friend".3) "TP expressions and sentences are ambiguous."Only if you want them to be. It can be surprisingly precise andspecific. First, because TP is smart enough to let context do the"heavy lifting" of communication. Natural langs. are overly specific. Second, you can qualify a term as much as you want. Someoneoncecriticized TP because it takes 6 words to translate "duck". But thisis based on how jan Pije rendered it in his Monty Python translationhttp://tokipona.esperanto-jeunes.org/text/mphg.html#Scene%205. Infact, "waso telo" suffices in most instances.mi mute o toki e pilin tu wan ni! mi toki sin e ni: mi wile sitelen etoki ni kepeken toki pona. taso mi jo ala e tenpo. jan Pita\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
