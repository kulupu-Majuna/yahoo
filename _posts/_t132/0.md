See, it's not all dead... Hiya! I'm Jay, and I found out about Toki Pona about a week agobecause of a post on the Slashdot forums. I've more or less got thegrammar at this point (Pije's been helping me with "La"... Thanks!)and I'm just working on learning the vocab. (which I'll pick upthrough doing rather than trying to memorize lists) Looks like thelang is a lot of fun, and I'm already demonstrating to my friends thejoys of being able to say things no one can understand. Hee hee. So, let's see... As this is a toki pona board, I suppose I shouldattempt to say something in it.toki! nimi mi li Jay. mi li sona e toki pona. mi li lon e Texas.toki pona li nasa e suwi. toki pona li pona tawa mi. mi wile e janpona tan toki pona.
