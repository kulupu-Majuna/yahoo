If you mean singing with words, I'd use toki musi. If they are just singing sounds but not words, kalama musi.toki musi could also mean chant or anything like that, not just sing. It might could also mean joke; I'd have to think about that some more.PijeDo you Yahoo!?Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo! HotJobs
