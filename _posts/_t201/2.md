> If you mean singing with words, I'd use toki musi. If they are justsinging sounds but not words, kalama musi.
>> toki musi could also mean chant or anything like that, not justsing. It might could also mean joke; I'd have to think about thatsome more.
>> Pijetoki musi, from what I've seen, goes with poem too. Maybe "li tokipoka/lon kalama musi" or something... kalama also can mean voicethough... anything audibly expressed...
