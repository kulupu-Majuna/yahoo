This is finally a right hand end problem.  jan pi kalama musi pona is ambiguous between '(janpi(kalama musi))pona' and 'jan pi ((kalama musi) pona)'  I suppose the suggestion to use 'pi' hereis an attempt to distinguish these two, though I am not sure which one is being aimed at --
probably the first.  As a general solution to this problem, we can either devise a new particle toend these things (the 'ku' or 'gu' of the Loglans) or declare 'pi' strictly binary (and so need todouble some of the up).  For this particular case, however, 'jan pi pona pi kalama musi'm a persongood at music' seems sufficient, even though a musician without comment ob hi/er skill is 'jan pikalama musi'.I've always thought that "pi" was binary, as you call it.So there would be no ambiguity over what "pona" modifies in "jan pi kalama musi pona": it's strictly "kalama musi".Can two "pi" ever occur together?  A pi pi B C D or something?jan Setepo / stevo
