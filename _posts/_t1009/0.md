Hello, I have an idea that I thought would be helpful for those learningtoki pona. I believe that if a chatterbot is generated with toki ponacommunication abilities, it would provide good practice for thoseinterested in learning the language, and would ultimately lead morepeople to more experience with the language. People could practicetheir knowledge, since face it, not many people know toki pona as ofnow. Maybe add this to the site. What does everyone else think?yan, Andi
