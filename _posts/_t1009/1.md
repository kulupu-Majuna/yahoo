I think chatting with people is more helpful. People can suggestinteresting themes for discussions and correct mistakes.There is official Toki Pona chat, but it is not used for practicingin Toki Pona. Visitors of this chat send messages in English.We can create new chat, for practicing only. Or we can appoint timefor meeting in offitial chat.Is this solution of practicing problem acceptable for you?Does anybody want to practice in chat?Maybe this chat already exists, but we do not know about it. Doesanybody know about such chat?---
