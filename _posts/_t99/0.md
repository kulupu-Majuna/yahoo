Lately, I've been seen a few differences when it comes tosaying "first" and "second" and words like that. If one wanted tosay "the second thing," would he say, "ijo pi nanpa tu" or would itbe "ijo nanpa tu"? And I'm assuming that "two things" is still "ijotu," right?Recently, Marraskuu told me to replace a sentence ("sina insa mi!")with "sina lon insa mi!" --
 Following this example, which of thesetwo is better to mean "I am under Leslie"?: "mi anpa jan Leli" or "milon anpa jan Leli"? If the latter is correct, why?Another idea that popped into my head but might be incorrect isdemonstrated in this sentence:o pana e mani tawa jan Sonja la ona li pona e lipu [http://Www.tokipona.orgGive](http://Www.tokipona.orgGive) money to Sonja, (so that) she will fix [http://www.tokipona.orgIs](http://www.tokipona.orgIs) this possible?
