I got tired of misspelling TP words, so I created a custom dictionary for MS Word of all 120 TP words. You can download it from here:  
  
https://aiki.pbworks.com/f/toki+pona.dic  
  
To install it, select Spelling & Grammar from the MS Word Tools menu. Select Options and then Custom Dictionaries. Select Add and then browse to the location of the 'toki pona.dic' file. Hit OK a few times and you are done. This is just a simple text file, so it should work with other word processors.  
  
The only minor problem is the Grammar checker highlights the lower case words at the beginning of each TP sentence as errors! But the Grammar checker can be turned off.  
  
Enjoy,  
Dave
