As I have said, many tp words differ only minimally. This can easily lead tomistakes --
 inspeaking as well as hearing --
 under anything less than perfect conditions. Butsome of thesesimilarities are more likely to cause problems than others. Unstressed vowels,for example, tendto run together, the more so the nearer they are. Even adjacent stressed vowelswill fade intoone another, depending upon environment (in a number of unclassifiable ways).Unstressedconsonants also can be mistaken for one another if similar. Happily, tp doesnot have manyconsonats that are only minimally different: there are no voiced-voicelesspairs, for example, andpoints and manner of articulation tend to be stronger separators. But still,syllable final n caneasily be lost or absorbed into the following consonant if from the same point,l and w slide intoone another, as do n and m (which are already identical in syllable finalposition. And adjacentstops do get confused as do t and s in some positions. And so on.---

 close or open, say (and,for Englishspeakers, diphthongized or not).

 maybe the front-back distinction is stonger than the high-midand mid-low.
