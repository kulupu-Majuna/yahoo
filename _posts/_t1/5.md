Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for thetokipona group:What do you think about reforming TokiPona from a 5 vowel system to a 3 vowelsystem? o The language already works. Let's keep the 5 vowels. Having 5 vowels insteadof 3 also gives the language a bit more colour and different sounds. o Let's find a way to convert the language into a more simple 3-vowel system.This may drastically change many words, but in the long run, the language willbecome simpler. o UndecidedTo vote, please visit the following web page:[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/surveys?id=10935084Note](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/surveys?id=10935084Note): Please do not reply to this message.
