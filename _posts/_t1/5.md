Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for the
tokipona group:

What do you think about reforming TokiPona from a 5 vowel system to a 3 vowel system? 

o The language already works. Let's keep the 5 vowels. 
Having 5 vowels instead of 3 also gives the language a bit more colour and different sounds. \
o Let's find a way to convert the language into a more simple 3-vowel system.
This may drastically change many words, but in the long run, the language will become simpler. \
o Undecided
