Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for the 
tokipona group:

"iki" seems to be too long and/or too similar to "ike". Should it be changed
to something else? 

o Leave it as is. (iki li suli mute. mi olin e iki.) \
o Drop "iki" when it's the subject and is understood. (li suli mute. mi olin eiki.)  \
o Change to "i". (i li suli mute. mi olin e i.) \
o Other solution...

To vote, please visit the following web page: \
