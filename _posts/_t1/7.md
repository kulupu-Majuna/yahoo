I wish you would've put an "undecided" choice on the poll. I'm ratherconservative, and if there are possible changes, I like to haveplenty of time to think about them. If I judge early, I always findthat several weeks later I've changed my mind, and that's the way mymind stays.I like the proposal in general, even though I wish we didn't have tochange things. The one thing I particularly don't like is the removalof "kan". As Marraskuu showed, it is quite possible to get along finewithout it, but, like I said, I'm quite conservative, and once I'vehad a word, I don't want to give it up, at least not until I've hadtime to adjust smoothly. "mi en/kin sina..." in a good deal of casesseems more rigid and artificial than the more friendly "mi ... kansina."As far as en and kin go, the change is a good idea, and I think itwould help clear up some confusion. The only objection I really haveis that I don't like the word "en." It seems like a very confused andawkward word to me. Maybe it's because it's so short or something;I'm not really sure. I'd prefer to see "kin" keep its status as "and"and have "en" become the word that intensifies whatever follows;perhaps that's just wishful thinking.I disagree with the idea of removing advanced numbers. Although Iagree that it can be and probably has been abused, I think the needfor higher numbers outweighs the bad usage. Imagine a boy playing anumber-guessing game:Man: "Hey kid, pick a number between wan and mute."Boy: "Okay! I pick ... umm... mute!"Man: "Nope. Sorry, kiddo. The number I had in mind was 'mute,'not 'mute'. Better luck next time."Anyhow, gotta go.--
