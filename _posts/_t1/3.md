Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for the
tokipona group:

Some Toki Pona speakers have expressed concerns that "iki" (he/she/it) and "ike"
(bad/evil) are too similar and may cause confusion. 
The result of a previous poll suggested we find a new solution. What do you suggest? 
(Sample sentences: iki li ike. mi olin e iki. = He is evil. I love him.) 

o don't change anything. keep "iki". everything is fine. (iki li ike. mi olin e iki.) \
o change "iki" to "ipi" (ipi li ike. mi olin e ipi.) \
o change "iki" to "ona" (ona li ike. mi olin e ona.) \
o none of the above are acceptable. let's find other solutions.
