Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for thetokipona group:Some Toki Pona speakers have expressedconcerns that "iki" (he/she/it)and "ike" (bad/evil) are too similarand may cause confusion. The result ofa previous poll suggested we find a newsolution. What do you suggest?(Sample sentences: iki li ike. mi oline iki. = He is evil. I love him.) o don't change anything. keep "iki". everything is fine. (iki li ike. mi oline iki.) o change "iki" to "ipi" (ipi li ike. mi olin e ipi.) o change "iki" to "ona" (ona li ike. mi olin e ona.) o none of the above are acceptable. let's find other solutions.To vote, please visit the following web page:[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/surveys?id=10657735Note](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/surveys?id=10657735Note): Please do not reply to this message.
