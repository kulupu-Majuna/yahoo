Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for the
tokipona group:

"ala" (nothing) and "ale" (everything)
are very similar in sound. Is this a
problem? 

o Everything is fine. Don't change anything. \
o We really need to consider changing something to avoid the confusion these 2
words can cause.


To vote, please visit the following web page: \
