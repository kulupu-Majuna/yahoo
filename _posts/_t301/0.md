>>mi toki jan. = I talk about people.
>>mi toki pi jan ike. = I talk about bad people.but I'm not sure that really makes sense.Using "e" to make the topic of speech or thoughtthe direct object of "toki" or "pilin" makes sense,and we do it all the time with "ni" as the object,referring forward to quoted direct speech following, e.g.,mi toki e ni tawa ona: "sina wile ala wile e moku?"
>To express speaking to someone, then, we can use

> mi toki e toki Inli: I talk about English.
> mi toki tawa ona. I talk to/speak with him/her.
> mi toki kepeken toki pona. I talk in TP.
> mi toki e toki Epelanto tawa ona kepeken toki pona. "I

> Likewise w/"pilin": mi pilin pona e tenpo ni pi mani. "I
> feel good about the economy \[financial present\]." "To worry
> about" can be expressed with "tan": mi pilin ike tan tenpo
> ni pi sijelo sina. "I'm worried about your current health.""pilin" with a direct object would seem to imply "think"rather than "feel". I would use "tan" to mark the causeof both "pilin pona" and "pilin ike". Also, the "pi" in"tenpo ni pi mani" is misplaced."mi pilin e toki pona." = I think about Toki Pona."mi pilin ike tan ali mani." = I feel bad about the money-all."mi pilin pona tan pona sijelo sina." = I am happy about yourgood health.But what about when you want to say,"I said nothing to him about my health."?Probably this:? mi toki ala e pona sijelo mi tawa ona.Or "I asked him about his health"?mi toki e ni tawa ona lon pona sijelo ona: "sijelo sina li pona ala pona?"Here I used "lon" for "about" because "e" is already used for "ni"and "lon" can hardly be confused for a locative preposition in thiscontext. Does that make sense to everyone else?- Jim Henryhttp://[http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/conlang/tokipona/tokipona.htm](http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/conlang/tokipona/tokipona.htm)
