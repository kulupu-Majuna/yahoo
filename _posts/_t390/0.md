I don't have hardly any opportunities to practice toki pona aloud.So I was wondering if you're supposed to use a glottal stop inbetween adjacent vowels to distinguish the two. Or is it likeSpanish where you just run the vowels together smoothly?jan sona o sona e mi. (or should I say "jan sona \[insertglottalization) o sona \[''\] e mi?")-jan Wasolitawa.
