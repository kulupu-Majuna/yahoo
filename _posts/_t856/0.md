There are more than enough potential number systems, I think I haveproposed mine also, but yesterday I came up with this:Since we have only 3 numbers, use tertiary base for countingalawantuwan alawan wanwan tutu alatu wantu tuwan ala alawan ala wanwan ala tuetcso while previously 'tu tu' was 2+2 (base 10) , or 'four', in thissystem it would represent 22 (base 3), or 'eight'.I know it is confusing
