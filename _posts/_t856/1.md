This seems a logical move, but the first purpose of large numbers in tp is justto read offaddresses of various sorts (first purpose in the sense that that is the easiestway to justifytheir inclusion in tp --
 as unofficial names). But addresses are inherentlydecimal (except urls,which are apparently hexadecimal --
 which means we need names for letters aswell). Once numbersare in ads names, of course, they will likely be used as quantifiers and thelike, but that is alater "aberration." By the way, even in a tresimal system like this,order-of-magntude markersare called for (though not, of course, for addresses, which are usually read asstrings of numbers --
 in English, anyhow)---
