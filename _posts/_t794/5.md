 "waso soweli" li ike tawa mi tan ni: thiswould be a bird having properties of a mammal or a bird resembling a mammal. A bat definitely is a mammal having the ability to fly (more or less) like a bird. So soweli is modified by waso, not the other way round. jan Elumutu I believe you are taking both "soweli" and "waso" too narrowly.  "Soweli" is not just a mammal, and "waso" is not just a bird. A bat is 'waso'.  Its flying is more salient than its being mammal. Parallel argument for 'whale'.  A whale is a waso.  Its swimming is more salient than its being a mammal.   jan Setepo / stevo Besseren Schutz gegen Spam - jetzt bei dem neuen Yahoo! Mail .
