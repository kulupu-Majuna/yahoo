It's discouraging when someone shows that they completelymisunderstand the meaning of a Toki Pona word due to ambiguities in asingle-word substitution in English.Have a look at the etymologies on the official Toki Pona web site.[http://tokipona.org/etym.htmlMany](http://tokipona.org/etym.htmlMany) of the words are from Esperanto, like "pali" (from "fari", "tomake or to do") and like "tomo" (from "domo", "(a) house"). You caneasily look those words up on web sites like [http://lernu.net/](http://lernu.net/) and Istrongly recommend doing so.
