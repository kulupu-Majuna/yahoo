Similarly, herewe are talkingabout the meanings of tp words, something that relates to tp, not Esperanto. Itturns out (or hasso far --
 time may alter all this, of course) that explaining tp semantics iseasier if you takethe transitive verbs (just about every tp word is one) as basic and derive themeanings of theother usages from them --
 even if the "other" meanings ar much more common. Ithink you canprobably do it the other way as well, though, because of the variety of types ofmore commonusages, the rules get more complex and indefinite. To be sure, for popularshorthand work, allsortds of othe rules get used (the noun-to-transitive verb rule, for example)but those are justhandy, not systematic.
