> But the argumentum etymologicum is invalid.So, are you still trying to say that "tomo" means "tobuild/construct"? I think "pali" fits that application much better.Let's look at the official word list:tomo - n indoor constructed space, e.g. house, home, room, building - mod urban, domestic, householdSo it seems to have a lot to do with "being indoors", houses, homes,ROOMS... habitations, dwellings, shelter, artificial living spaces forpeople... not about the act of construction. As a transitive verb itwould mean, "to shelter", "to house" or "to host" (eo: "gastigi","endomigi").Let's look again at the official word list:pali - n activity, work, deed, project - mod active, work-related, operating, working - vt do, make, build, create - vi act, work, functionNow \*this\* is about making and building things, the act ofconstruction. It's right there in the transitive verb formdefinition."mi pali e tomo." = "I'm building a house."How would you say it instead?jan Wiko
