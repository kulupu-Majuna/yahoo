While looking at the rule set recently I realized that "li" feels more like part of the predicate than part of the subject.  So I have changed the pertinent rules.  The rules pertaining to "li" are P4, P5, and T1.  Here is the latest version of them:P4 <Subject
> ::= "o"      | <Nominal
>      |  "o" <Nominal
> P5 <Predicate
> ::= "li" <Noun-Phrase
> \[<Prep-Phrase
>\*\]      | "li" <Modifier
>\* \[<Prep-Phrase
>\] | "li" <Verb-Phrase
> \[<Prep-Phrase
>\]      | "li" <Predicate
> <Predicate-Conjunction
> <Predicate
>T1: If subject is "mi" or "sina" then delete immediately following "li".As always, please let me know if this has any problems or causes any inconsistencies with the rest of the grammar.jan Setepo / stevo
