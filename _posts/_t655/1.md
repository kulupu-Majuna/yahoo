the advantage of putting it in asthe end of the subject (rather than the beginning of the predicate) is that you can eliminate thetransformation by writing a special caluse in the P4 dealing with "mi" and "sina" explicitly. It'snot clear whether this is an overall saving or whther it has any effects.I suppose I could put separate clauses for "mi" and "sina" in P4, but I deal with these two exceptions in T1, so it's not necessary. Â As you indicate, it's a toss-up either way.jan Setepo / stevo
