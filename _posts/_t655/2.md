Like Lojban {cu}, "li" doesn't seem to fit anywhere exactly. the advantage ofputting it in asthe end of the subject (rather than the beginning of the predicate) is that youcan eliminate thetransformation by writing a special caluse in the P4 dealing with "mi" and"sina" explicitly. It'snot clear whether this is an overall saving or whther it has any effects.---
