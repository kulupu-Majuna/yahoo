I liked your translations. They're creative. But I dowant to comment on a few of them.Set 1, 24. "Bad hair day"tenpo pi ken ala pali e linjatime of inability to build the hairThis phrase in Toki Pona is not grammatically correct.You can't put a whole verb phrase as being a nounafter the pi. I might suggest making the translationmore direct: "tenpo suno pi linja ike".Set 2, 6. The person who shot JFK worked for the CIA.TP: jan li moli e jan Kenesi li pali lon kulupu insasona.En: Person shot person named Kennedy and worked in thecentral group of knowledge.Set 2, 16. The CEO of IBM is the spouse of someonepresent.TP: jan suli pi kulupu IBM li jan olin pi jan lon.En: Big person of group called IBM is the SO ofsomebody present.I've never seen lon used as an adjective. The TPdictionary doesn't mention that it can be used assuch. Not exactly sure how I might fix the sentence,though.Set 2, 41. The only pear left on the tree is rotten.TP: kili taso lon kasi ni li jaki.En: Only fruit on this plant is polluted.Grammatically, you can't have prepositional phrases inthe subject. They have to go at the end. I might writethis sentence as: kili wan taso li awen lon kasi ni.ona li jaki.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!
