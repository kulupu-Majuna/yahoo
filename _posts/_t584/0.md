3\. Toki Pona already has an official and universally accepted way to use names.  In fact, there is a long list of place names online, with names like "Kanse" for 'French' and "Kanata" for "Canadian".  People, places, languages, even religions can all be referred to by names.  Other concepts, and numbers in particular, can also be referred to by names.  Using "San" for the name of 'three', we can saynanpa San li nanpa pi tu en wan li nanpa wan en tuSuch number names cannot be used directly in expressions like "tu tu".  Thus "San tu" or "tu San" for 6 is ungrammatical, because San is a name of a number and not the number itself.  Using "nanpa", names can be given to any and all numbers.jan Setepo / stevo
