It does seem to come up often enough though... for something to stick it thinkit wouldhave to be simple and (relatively) universal, and not reliant on memorizing aconventionlike one/two open/closed.'poka pilin' for left seems to return enough to prove useful.I think something like 'poka pali' could work as a compliment, since most people(myselfexcluded) seem to be right-handed.personally I'm not a fan of adding 'ala' as a solution for creating acompliment.Cardinal directions seem much harder to translate into satisfying toki pona. There is atendency in many languages to ascribe colors to directions. This could create asimplesolution, but again requires memorizing an arbitrary system.As I understand it, using "North East South West: instead of "Left, Right" meansdirectionsare given regardless of the speakers position, and not that Left is referred toas West, andRight as East. This works for instance in giving directions to one's house, butnot meanthe "top right corner of a piece of paper" is "North-East" Does anyone else havea feelingon that?just my 2 cents- jan Josan---

Butno systemfor directional notions seems totally safe from these comments. And there arethose inkulupu pi toki pona who would argue that the tp world would not use them anyhow(cf'big' numbers).
