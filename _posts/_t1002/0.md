Then why not avoid talking about it altogether? Your point does seem reasonable.As I learned to express myself in TP, I never had to use left or right in asentence. We only talked about it because of a rookie Tokiponist (no offencemeant)Â :) jan Pusa---

But no system for directional notions seems totally safe from thesecomments. And there are those in kulupu pi toki pona who would argue that the tpworld would not use them anyhow (cf 'big' numbers).\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_From: liogab11 <liogab11@yahoo. com

> ? left, right?I prefer to say "poka pi suno kama" for right; "poka pi suno weka"for left, since we are talking about left and right.After all, if we look at a world map, east will point to our right;west, to our right.As for north and south, I belive "lete" and "seli" (aside from coldand hot) are used for north and south regardless of the locations ofthe speaker and the person spoken to.jan Pusa---
