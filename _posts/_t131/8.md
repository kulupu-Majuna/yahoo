> nimi mi li jan "Corey".I probably would have said {nimi mi li "Corey"} - I'd consider {janKowi} to refer to a person and {Kowi} to be the name itself. (InLojban, the difference between {la koris.} and {zo koris.} - {zo koriscmene mi}, not {la koris cmene mi}, which would mean "My name isCorey" \[i.e. "The thing that is my name is the same as the person thatis called 'Corey' - the name is a person\] rather than "My name is'Corey'". \[i.e. "The thing that is my name is 'Corey'" - the name is aword\]).However, I'm not certain how (or whether) Toki Pona makes thisdistinction. Still, "nimi mi li jan XYZ" seems wrong to me.In fact, to introduce myself, I'd probably just say "mi jan Pili",using "jan" as a verb meaning "to be a person", or jan + modifier as averb meaning "to be a person with a certain name".
> mi tawa tenpo ni."tenpo ni la mi tawa" is, I think, how you'd say "I go now". "tenpo"is only glossed with noun meanings on the word list I have, so I'm notsure whether your sentence (where "tenpo" modifies "tawa") isgrammatical or what meaning it has.Simply "mi tawa" is probably enough, though - is it really importantto say that it is \*now\* that you are going? Keep things simple ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") aleli pona.
