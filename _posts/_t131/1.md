I'd say that the website is, byfar, not up to date with the changes that have taken place in thepast year or so in Toki Pona. However, what's on Toki Pona is, forthe most part, correct, although you still need to know aconsiderable amount more before you can say that you've got a stronggrasp on Toki Pona.Personally, the dialect differences aren't very noticeable; Marraskuuseldom comes to the chat room, and so I rarely get an opportunity tocompare the chat room Toki Pona to anything else. However, during thefew times that Marraskuu HAS come, he has made quite a fewsuggestions on things that should be changed in how to speak. So, itseems that differences do exist. As time has passed, thesedifferences have more than likely widened, but I do not know to whatextent if at all.This isn't exactly the best type of topic to use Toki Pona to talkabout, but unless there's anyone on the list who doesn't know Englishwell, maybe this will give you the general idea:lipu Tokipona.org li pona. taso ona li pana ala e sona ali pi tokipona. ijo sin li kama tawa toki pona. sina wile sona e ijo sin ni.toki pona ante li lon.
