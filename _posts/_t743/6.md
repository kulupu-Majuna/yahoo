But, as in Lojban, complete sentences may seem to assert something only to findat the end thatthey merely lay out a hypothetical situation "X la Y" = "X only if Y" but whilerading X it seemsto be an unqualified assertion. So, the meaning or function can be seen tochange. Conversely,once the whole sentence is out, the subject is clear in ordinary sentences,whether third personor "mi" or "sina" or modified same; it is only in the partial flow that thereare (theseparticular) problems (there are other problems, involving modifiers andprepositions, that remaineven when the hole sentence is before. And even once the grammar is clear, theinterpretation issometimes up for grabs.)---
