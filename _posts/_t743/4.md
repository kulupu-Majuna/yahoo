> The same with "la",I don't think so. I never felt the "oh! problem" about "la", because"la" doesn't change \*the meaning\* or \*the function\* of the wordsbefore, as "li" does. "la" means: "in that context", "when that saidhappens/happened", "under the condition mentioned"... In some sense,it is a normal modifier because it modifies all said before, doesn'tit? But, I repeat, the meaning and function of words before "la" arekept."li" is a very different thing: it is a wild frontier ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") , so youdon't know where you really are and \*what the words mean\* until youfind it.. or not! ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\
