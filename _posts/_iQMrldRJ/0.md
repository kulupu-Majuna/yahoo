...which, if I said it right, should mean "I don't know how to speak well." Not sure how I would say "...in the language Toki Pona."  
  
In any case...  
  
  
Toki!  
  
I'm picking up the language at the moment, just completing the lessons. I had a grammar question though (I'm sure I'll have more... hopefully that's okay for this forum...)  
  
In lesson 11, we learn that you can say  
  
sina pali e ni kepeken nasin seme? -- You made this using what method? How did you make this?  
  
  
...but, could you also say  
  
sina pali seme e ni  
  
You made (in some manner I don't know) this? In what manner did you make this?  
  
Of course, it's not quite the same question as by what method did you make this - I'm simply curious if it's a legitimate formation.  
  
  
  
  
Also...  
  
ma li pona lukin tawa mi  
  
"the countryside is good looking to me"  
  
...is this properly formatted? I'm trying to understand the 'no clause' aspect of the language, but this confuses me. Could somebody point to some examples of which sentences need to be split up when translated and which don't?  
  
  
  
  
and one more for the moment...  
  
mi mute li pali e wili mi mute tan ken mi mute  
  
...we do what we must because we can -?  
  
  
  
  
Thanks!
