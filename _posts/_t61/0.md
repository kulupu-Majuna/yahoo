I have posted the following guidelines:[http://www.tokipona.org/tokiponize.phpThey](http://www.tokipona.org/tokiponize.phpThey) should be helpful to those who wonder if there is a generalsystem for converting foreign words into the phonetic system of TokiPona.Please let me know if there are specific phonemes or situations thatI haven't covered in these guidelines, and I will add them.Sonja
