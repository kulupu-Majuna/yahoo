Firstly, I just wanted to clarify my thought that people's first andlast names are usually blended together when Toki-Ponizing them, likethis: "John Doe" becomes "Santo". Is that correct?Even though you should probably blend the first and last names, I'vebeen wondering, just out of curiosity, how the name would betranslated if for some reason you weren't supposed to blend the firstand last names together... For "John Doe," would it make better senseto put John's last name first, and then his actual first name wouldcome second, to simply show which type of Doe he is, like this: "ToSan". This seems to make better sense to me, because I feel that alast name is more important than a first name, and so it should bementioned first, just as a noun is listed before its adjectives innormal speech.What does everyone else think? Of course, this is probably all merelyhypothetical, since, if I'm not mistaken, you simply blend the firstand last names together anyhow.mi wile lape.--
