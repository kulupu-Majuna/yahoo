Hello,  
  
  
  
I tried to call and got somehow to the Ethnologue staff. The person there  
  
directed me finally to this address and to the website, and said he couldn't  
  
give me the number. So here is my mail.  
  
Some time ago we have submitted a form about Toki Pona to acquire a language  
  
code. The request received disapproval. I didn't see any motivation on this  
  
decission and I would like to see about that if possible.  
  
Now several times yet I wanted to translate something and needed a language  
  
code (World of Goo, http://tinyurl. com/wogwiki , and forvo.com)  
  
In the first case the webmaster finally decided to use 'tp' as no other  
  
language than toki pona ever uses that code, and in the second case we  
  
finally decided to use x-tp (because of limited space in the database  
  
fields, otherwise we would have used x-tokipona). Now my questions are:  
  
\- When, which and how should I fill in forms again to apply for this year's  
  
round of language code assignment?  
  
\- What do you recommend in those cases mentioned to get the language  
  
properly registered in those systems?  
  
(I want to note furtheron that I carbon-copy this mail to several other  
  
people. The first one is the person who did the first request, the second  
  
one is the yahoo-list of Toki Pona speakers, to keep them up to date about  
  
this. It's however not all Toki Pona speakers who are in there, it is  
  
however the biggest group known to date keeping contact with each other in  
  
and about toki pona.)  
  
  
  
Thanks for your willingness to pay attention to this mail, and thanks for  
  
any reaction soon,

appointed moderator of the Yahoo list and fluent speaker of Toki Pona

Communication is essential. So we need decent tools when communication is  
  
lacking, when language capability is hard to acquire...

Only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible. I think it's  
  
in my basement... let me go upstairs and check.
