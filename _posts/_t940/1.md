Yes it is, technically.  But many tp sentences are --
 maybe most.  If you want to be less ambiguous, you use two sentences (which makes better rhetorical sense) for the second version (though 'anu' connecting sentences is rare).  Another possibility (which may not be legal --
 but this is still a developing language) would be to put 'li' in front of 'akesi.' tp is the antiLojban in many respects.-----
