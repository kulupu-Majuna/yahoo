so, do we really need "X ala X," as in "sina sona ala sona e toki  
pona?" Couldn't we just say, "sina sona e toki pona?" when we want a  
yes/no question?  
<<< jan Sonja is to decide. I think that, in order to distinguish an "anu" question from an "anu" sentence, we might start the former with, e.g.: "mi wile sona e ni:" to make clear that it's a question; otherwise it's a normal sentence of statement.

Oh, and since "tomo tawa kon" is a subset of "tomo tawa," I would have  
just said "...kepeken tomo tawa." If I wanted to specify "a car and  
an airplane," I would say "tomo tawa ma en tomo tawa kon."

be used in questions only. In clauses of statement, some tricks may be  
helpful, e.g.: mi wile sona e ni: mi kama lon sina kepeken e tomo tawa  
anu tomo tawa kon. / mi kama lon sina. tomo tawa en tomo tawa kon li  
sama pona tawa mi (long live the context). mi ante e nimi "book" tan  
toki Inli tawa toki pona kepeken ken mute: "leko lipu" en "leko toki"  
en "leko pi lipu toki". ken ale ni li pona tawa mi.
