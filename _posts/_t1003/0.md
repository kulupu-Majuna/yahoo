Hi, everyone! I'm still taking Pije's lessons (yes, I'm quiteslow...), and having doubts.In lesson four, the given translation of "Pineapple is a food and isgood" is "kili li moku li pona". I couldn't understand why itshouldn't be "kili e moku e pona" instead. In this case, "moku" and"pona" mean "to be a food" and "to be good"?Please help me. Thanks a lot.jan Lejanto(Leandro Silva Abreu)
