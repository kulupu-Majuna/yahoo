Hey AvrilI was wondering what type of class on Toki Pona you had taken. If I remember correctly, I recently saw a site somewhere that offered a day-course type of thing about Toki Pona. Toki Pona has quite a small community, so I was wondering how there could be a class about it. Where is the class taught at? Who teaches it? How do they know Toki Pona? How much did you learn?--
