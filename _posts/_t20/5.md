Wow, people from two of the classes that I taughtare on this list! :)I found out about Toki Pona because I speakEsperanto and visit Esperanto-speaking friends inCanada all the time ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") I think I had first seen itmentioned in an article in the Esperanto-versionof the Wikipedia (eo.wikipedia.org). This pastJune, I was in Montreal and my friends werespeaking it, so I decided that I wanted to learn,but never got anywhere. Then in October, I wentto an Esperanto gathering in Vermont where two ofmy Canadian friends gave a spontaneous 1-hourpresentation of Toki Pona that was a lot of fun.I teach Esperanto and have a 1-hour presentationon constructed languages that I occasionally give.This year, I decided to add Toki Pona to myrepertoire, since it was so much fun in Vermont.I was kind of hoping that committing to teaching itwould motivate me to finally learn the vocabulary,but no such luck ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") The first class was forSPLASH, like Lauren mentioned, a weekend event atMIT where MIT students can offer classes inanything they want to high school students whocome to take classes for the weekend. The secondclass was during MIT's January inter-semesterperiod, for members of the MIT community.For the SPLASH class, I had tried to makehandouts, but was thwarted by MS Word, and alsosomething like a hundred people came, so there wasno way I was going to have that many handoutsanyway! For the MIT class, I succeeded in makingsome handouts. They're at:[http://web.mit.edu/quark/Public/Prelegoj/TokiPona/](http://web.mit.edu/quark/Public/Prelegoj/TokiPona/)(Sorry, if I had known I was making them public, Iwould have made PS and PDF formats available.)They could still use some work --
 correcting typosand adding more material. It's all taken from theTokiPona website. The grammar handout is just theimportant excerpts from the eight lessons ontokipona.org. I also added my own section about"seme", and a list at the end of clever or amusingconstructions, and changed uses of "iki" to "ona."It could use a section about "la" and othergrammar points missing from the website.Anyway, it's cool that I sparked some interest inthe language. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") Maybe we can start a local TokiPona club and meet and practice speaking ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") I'vebeen trying to convince some friends in Providenceto start a regular "Toki Pona table" ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
