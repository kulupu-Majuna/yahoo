I find these lists just fascinating, since I immediately recognize both the"only intransitive"verbs as being transitive too (put to sleep, put in place) and many of the onlytransitive ones asalso intransitive (or, at worst, reflexive but unmarked). In some cases, thesemay bedistinguishing out nominal or adjectival complements from verbs ("He is cold"for "ona li lete"rather than "He is freezing"). Further, many of these "verbs" are hard to seeas verbs at all,especially transitive ones: ijo, say, or jan (we don't really say in tp thatsomeone jans a boat,do we?). And notice the odd difference between lukin and kute, for example, ortoki and sitelen.I suspect that what this list is of is words that have served in various verbroles in somelimited corpus, maybe even every bit of tp up to some time. The list should notbe used to limitwhat will happen outside that corpus, especially since much of tp materialpoints to the claimthat, in appropriate circumstances, almost any word can function in almost anygrammaticalcategory (the syncategorematics probably excepted). If nothing else we have therule that for anycategorematic B, A li B e C, is a legitimate sentence, meaning --
 if not alreadyappropriated --
 Abrings about the verification of C li B. Making prepositions is trickier andcertain paths havebeen headed off (body parts can't be preps on their own, they need "lon"). Amore interestingtopic is trying to figure out about various classes of established verbs howtheir pieces fittogether: the wile class and the tawa class, with kama fitting into both, andthe possible --
 butlargely unexplored --
 open classs (open, pini, maybe awen --
 and maybe kama yetagain)---
