The only prepositions are : kepeken, lon, poka, sama,tan and tawa. As long as "poka" is accepted as a preposition, "sewi", "anpa" and "monsi" should as well be able to act asprepositions, shouldn't they? jan ElumutuIn fact, poka never was a preposition on its own. Correct is: lon poka. Just like this, lon sewi, lon anpa and lon monsi are useable.
