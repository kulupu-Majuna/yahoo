"poka" is a preposition but not meaning "on/at/in the side of " but "with"(accompaniment). Forthe literal spatial location X relative to an object, "lon X" is to be used (theothers werepropeitions early on, but were changed --
 I suspect mainly to allow "poka" itsbroader sense,replacing an earlier "kan").---
