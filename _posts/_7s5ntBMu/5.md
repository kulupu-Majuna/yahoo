I always wondered whether that was inherent in the language or because i'm not fluent enough. i guess a bit of both.  
the short sentences actually make tp easier to grok, but the similar sounds and short words make it a bit hard to read imho.  
  
That being said, a lot of my time writing tp is actually spent thinking about how to say things. it's just not as easy as translating into another language because the concept of tp is so different. so i guess tp would be pretty bad in such a test.  
  
i guess i'd take about half an hour currently (not really having activly used tp for about a year).
