OK sorry, it's because English isn't my first language - French is.  
  
However I don't like long tp texts because I can't understand them. You shouldn't try to compare tp with other languages that have more words.  
  
Try first to say meaningful, shorts sentences in it, even if this will take you some time. Long texts are really hard to understand.
