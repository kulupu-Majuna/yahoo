Speed is important because we're discussing a NaNoWriMo type even  
where you write in the conlang of your choice, but in order to do that  
we need to set a goal of how many words someone would write in the  
month.

I didn't ask how long it would take to translate it. In fact I  
specifically said "not translate". I asked how long it would take to  
write something that long in Toki Pona. Saying "200 words" doesn't  
mean a lot to most people, so I provided a visual example of just how  
long 200 words was.

This is not even remotely incompatible with Toki Pona's philosophy.  
You did not understand what I wrote.
