mi mute  
  
actually used, admitted for daily use, avoidable when the plurality of  
the people spoken about is already clear

comparable story, but is much more encouraged not to use it. only use  
it when you really needs to get the plurality clear (I can say that  
about mi mute as well).

used a lot, status debatable. officially deprecated, but not always  
avoidable and highly preferred over e.g. tu tu wan  
  
if in doubt about large numbers and it doesn't matter a lot, use "mute"

Communication is essential. So we need decent tools when communication  
is lacking, when language capability is hard to acquire...
