I would like to add some memory tricks to remember Toki Pona vocabulary.For example, jan Ewen (Aaron Chapman) told me he remembels "walo" withthe sentence "The \_walls\_ are white."Please submit your personal memory tricks, or help come up with newones. I'd like to populate the Toki Pona dictionary with mnemonics tomake learning vocabulary even easier.Peace,jan Sonjamama pi toki pona
