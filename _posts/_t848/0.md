>> Why do you keep trying to express complex things in Toki Pona?Well said, Rick.It brings three thoughts to mind.chapter 1The man who paints his house with a toothbrush rather than a paintroller or a paint sprayer not only wears out the toothbrush, he alsoreveals to his neighbors how unreasonable he is.chapter 2Could clocks even exist in the ideal society of Toki Pona?Clocks are an instrument of social control, made possible and madenecessary by the industrial devolution.Clocks make possible such horrors as factories, schools and prisons."If there is an alarm clock in your house, you do not have freedom inany meaningful sense of the word."chapter 3I think the people of Toki Poni would arrange meetings and so forth byexpressing the angle of the sun (or some bright star at night) abovethe horizon.You can roughly estimate this angle by holding your hand at arm'slength in a certain position."I will meet you when the sun has risen about three hands above theearth" or something along those lines.sincerely,Rick Harrison
