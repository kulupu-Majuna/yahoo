We can't use that as a guideline.As for "clocks", they can indeed be simple. The concepts of daily andyearly cycles isn't complex. I only object to dividing them up intoso many tiny pieces.Estimating time of day by angles measured from the horizon is a badidea. It changes with the seasons and it changes with lattitude. Abetter system is that of the "Scandinavian Daymarks".For a meeting time, you need only name a specific geographical featurewhich will be directly below the sun at the desired time, i.e. ("tenpopi suno lon nena Fudi").jan Wiko.
