Toki!! nice to meet you :)I was thinking that, I don't know any primitive languages, but when Istudied TP, I thought, that's how a primitive language is supposed to belikeThen thought, if it was really a primitive language of an isolatedtribe, how could it evolve then?Some small words becoming articles, verbs combined together to formtenses, words merged to form plural, declensions etc...I thought that li would naturally evolve to become a form of a copula(mi li = I am??), while e, would evolve to be a general article. Perhapsthen a combination of li and jo followed by a verb would form sometenses (mi jo toki = i talked??). I can't imagine how the plural wouldform since mute seems unsuitable for an an ending. Perhaps it would bereduced to -te when suffixed to words (tokite = languages??). I alsodon't know if verbs should be conjugated if they became more complex.The pronouns would become suffixes and form conjugations like in latinor sanskrit (tokimi, tokisi \[sina\], tokina \[ona\]? and how the pluralwould be?)I know this is a bit off topic and it has nothing to do with the visionof TP. As I said it's just a passing thought and only an amusing play,so I don't plan ever to start a project to show a possible 'future' TPin a conworld inhabited by a TP-speaking tribe. However I think it's afood for thought and I'd like to hear your musings :)Mi tawa
