This is fun! Aside from the fact that primitive languages are as varied asnon-primitive ones,some a complex as Sanskrit, some as simple as Chinese (and if you take all thefactors intoaccount, the consensus is that all natural languages are about equally complex;they just differin where the complexity is), having tp follow the developmental pattern ofIndo-European is aninteresting idea (though I-E has gone pretty far back toward isolating frominflected, at least insome branches). I suppose, I would picture a somewhat different future, morelike Chinese in somerespects: developing longer words out of combinations of the basic words andcrunching these downto manageable size. I don't see inflections developing but I would expects moreprepositions(from almost anything that could conceivably be one). Nor would I expect athorough tense systemto arise, though the use of "kama" and "pini" and maybe a few other might becomeregularized. Iam not so clear about things like articles, though, if one comes along, I wouldexpect it to comefrom "ni" and come at the end, ala Swedish.Notice that tp already has a sort of conworld, our world stripped back as far aspossible --
 and aline of development, to deal with our world in all its complexity. Along thatline ofdevelopment, I expect the first thing would be more number words, at least forreading digits (butonce those exist, the other uses are hard to suppress). It might, indeed, bemore interesting totell the story of how tp might evolve from modern languages as the society fallsapart (or thespeakers flee to isolation).kipo---
