I am in the midst writing a book that fully teaches Toki Pona, showsmany examples of grammar and usage, clarifies many grey areas in thegrammar and description, and will include many all-new comics andgames and fun cutural stuff. A sort of "bible" and authority book onall things Toki Pona. The book may take a year or two before it's ready.If you would like to be a language consultant and have a word infine-tuning some aspects of the language, please write a paragraph orshort letter IN TOKI PONA explaining your interest in the project [tosonja@kisa.caIf](mailto://tosonja@kisa.caIf) you believe you have a fairly advanced level of Toki Pona and wouldlike to shape the language's core structures and its future, Iencourage you join in.If I find that your level of profiniency in the language is highenough, I will invite you to a special members-only list of "jan sona"(masters) of Toki Pona.Please spread the word to various relatively advanced speakers of TokiPona who maybe don't frequent this Yahoo! group and require outreach.Sonja
