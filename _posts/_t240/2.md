Yes, please use my lessons at [http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/lesson/lesson0.html](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/lesson/lesson0.html). I worked very hard on them with the hopes that more people would learn Toki Pona from them. Despite tokipona.org stating that the lessons are outdated, I confidently would tell anyone interested in Toki Pona to use those lessons to help them along. With that said, if any fluent speaker does see some real flaws in my lessons, I'd be happy to take the comments. Switching topics a bit, I want to let everyone know that I just uploaded today a translation/hack of Super Mario World from the Super Nintendo. If you're into emulation and/or want to play this game, go to [http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/game/game.html](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/game/game.html). Although I don't foresee any problems, email me if you really do want to play the game and are having a hard time making it work. PijeDo you Yahoo!?Friends. Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger
