Attached are the gleanings from todays scanning of text. Some of these areprobably already inthe lists; some are probably pretty awful. Tell me about either of theseproblems (and suggestbetter for the awfuls --
 or the good, for that matter.)The revisions of the sheets I circulated earlier are too long to send to peoplewho don't wantthem but are available on request. So far they just have the idioms listedunder every majorword, but no new information.
