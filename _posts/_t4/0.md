Indeed! I began by translating a whole bunch of A-words just as an
experiment to see if Toki Pona can really handle the complexities of
communication. It was also a way to see if there are any basic
concepts or new words I may need to add or change.

The focus now is to have a more general and usable list. You will
notice that I have begun using this list to expand the EN\>TP
dictionary: [http://esl.about.com/library/vocabulary/bl1000_list1.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20021206104919/esl.about.com/library/vocabulary/bl1000_list1.htm) 

pona tawa jan ale!
