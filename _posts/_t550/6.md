However, I'm sure there are simpler texts totranslate than the Bhagavad Gita. It was just an attempt to see howcomprehensiveness would be attained through a very minimal languagelike toki pona. I was more in paraphrasing, since calling it atranslation is a misnomer to me.

I'm quite conservative about adding new words; I triedtranslating the first chapter and another chapter and failed becauseof the high concepts. But why translating? Because toki pona opens themind to what is the bare essential instead.To say "pali e jan" is to work someone, as opposed "to work to/forsomeone"."lon" is pretty much any directional preposition.Well, the original is Form, so I didn't know how to translate, HisForm as Krishna (jan sewi Kisina).

Perhaps I can try?3-4 jan li pali sewi tawa ale sewilon nasin ante pi pilin mute.ni li lon insa ale li pana ala e sona onali ante ala li tawa ala li nasin sona pi pona ale.jan li lon nasin pi pilin ale lon ale lajan li kama pini tawa mi.

>> "pona ala" in the sense of "difficult"Well, it sounded better than using "ike." I might rephrase what I saidas instead:5 pilin jan li awen lon ale sewipi sitelen ala laona li kama lon nasin pi pona ala.kama kepeken pali ni li pona ala tawa jan.
