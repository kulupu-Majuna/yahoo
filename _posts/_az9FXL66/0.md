As some have noticed, I've made a few changes to my site lately:  
  
I have released all of my content into the public domain. I made this decision because of moral concerns and because of my deeply-held political convictions (I am an anarcho-capitalist). If you would like more details, you may visit the copyright information page: http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/copyright.html  
  
Almost all of the pages now have a white background. This looks more fashionable than the black backgrounds used in the past. Some of the pages also have newer, more aesthetic artwork.  
  
I may make other changes to the site in the future, potentially including a rewrite of the "o kama sona e toki pona!" lessons. I will post an announcement if I decide to make such changes.  
  
Thanks,
