A modern IAL (international auxiliary language) must be suited forscientific discourse. English is. Esperanto is. Toki Pona ismost decidedly not. When I asked Marraskuu in IRC how he woulddescribe how to build a house, he responded that speakers of TokiPona would learn more by doing than by hearing or by reading.Somebody who has done it before would know how long of a piece ofwood is "mute pona" == enough.Analogy to \_The Time Machine\_ by H. G. Wells: From what I'vegathered, Toki Pona is intended as a language for Eloi, ratherthan as a language for Morlocks.How precious.--
