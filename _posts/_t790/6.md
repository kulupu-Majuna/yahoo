Batural Semantic Metalanguage. The teory is that there is a set of conceptswhich every languageexpresses with fairly basic words and in terms of which all concepts can bedefined, using only alimited grammar ("the same" for every language). The grammar is pretty muchthat of tp and, asnoted , tp has all the current list of basic concepts (though not all as basic--
 and the list hasbeen evolving over the years, so more my be added). Tp also has other conceptsas basic, so itought to have advantages over NSM for defining and hence expressing.---
