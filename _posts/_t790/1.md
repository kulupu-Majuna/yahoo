Thanks.  If this is right, then we should theoretically be ab;le to say anything at all in tp (oofcourse, there is some doubt about how good the theory is).But NSM is mainly for defining words.  Since new words are frowned on in Toki Pona, there doesn't seem to be much point in being able to define any other language's words in TP since that definition would likely be the shortest way to say it in TP.stevo / jan Setepo
