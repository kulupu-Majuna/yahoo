The point is that the definitions, or some derivatives of them give expressions(hopelessly long,perhaps) for any word or corresponding idea. Talking NSM for a given languageis not veryefficient, but is claimed to be comprehensive. If tp has NSM covered and a fewthings to spare,then it is theoretically comprehensive as well.---
