There is already an arbitrary definition of left and right in Toki Pona.  
The written form of the language goes from left to right.  
  
Therefore the most logical differentiation between left and right  
would be "poka pi nanpa wan" and "poka pi nanpa tu" (side#1 and  
side#2), from the viewpoint of the person doing the looking.
