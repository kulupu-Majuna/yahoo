When talking by phone or communicating in writing, it's no use to point to this or another direction, but you'll definitely need words to denote directions.

Well, toki pona, is mostly dedicated for simple discourse, to be  
fastly learned and usable. So it's designed firstly for "survival"  
sentences. "I am ..." "I feel sick", "I need a biere", etc...  
In this category, I put also the fact to ask his way when you are in  
a foreign country. (Ok, the probability to find a tokiponist in New  
york is very low, but no matter). So in that sense, "left" and "right",  
are really needed.  
  
  
I disagree. You can always point which direction you mean, even a future direction. The words for "left" and "right" aren't necessary.  
Some whole cultures get by without these words.
