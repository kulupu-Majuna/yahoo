Well, toki pona, is mostly dedicated for simple discourse, to be  
fastly learned and usable. So it's designed firstly for "survival"  
sentences. "I am ..." "I feel sick", "I need a biere", etc...  
In this category, I put also the fact to ask his way when you are in  
a foreign country. (Ok, the probability to find a tokiponist in New  
york is very low, but no matter). So in that sense, "left" and "right",  
are really needed.
