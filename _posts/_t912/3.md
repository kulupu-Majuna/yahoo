I've only seen tokiponist and tokiponian in usage.  Now that I think about it, the "ist" sounds more like someone who espouses the views of toki pona and tokiponian sounds like someone who lives in the land of toki pona.   I guess tokiponiphone (cf francophone) would be more semantically accurate, someone who speaks toki pona.  Tokiponese would be the logical English name for the language, but so far a google search only shows two references to the usage, both on Italian webpages.
