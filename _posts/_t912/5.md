> mama pi toki ponaPersonally, I write 'tper,' which I say as 'tea pea er' but means 'tokiponer.' This last has thevirtue of being, for me, a pun (my idiolect contains traces of a dialect inwhich 'er'ispronounced with a vowel well within the range of tp unstressed 'a' --
 andunstressed 'a' isrhotacized). But more to the point, it - being an agentive derivative (interalia) - suggestssomeone who is doing something, not just believing in something or dwelling insome realm.
