IMHO, tokiponist and tokiponian seem to fit well although I prefer "tokiponian" a little bit, partly because this term has often been used in this group and partly because in my native German language it would be "Tokiponianer" because the ending -ist is mainly used to denote a professional (chemist, analyst) rather than an amateur. One might say that you - as mama pi toki pona - are a tokiponist while I am more of a tokiponian who deals with tp as an interesting and beautiful hobby. tp forever!
