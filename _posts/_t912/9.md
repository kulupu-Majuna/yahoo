>I've seen "Tokiponist" and "Tokiponan," though the latter is used muchmore for a hypothetical Toki Pona-speaking culture than for the membersof this list. I think both are good, but I like Tokiponist because wesay "Esperantist" for a speaker of Esperanto. I don't like "Tokiponer"(or "Toki Poner") because it invites people to make lots of dirtyjokes, if you know what I mean. (This, I'm sure, is why we call atrombone player a "trombonist.")jan Sosuwa
