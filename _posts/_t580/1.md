What about nanpa luka ("the number of a hand") for 5, instead of just luka (for the rare cases where a tokiponian would say 5 ![:P](images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz"))... and nanpa pi luka tu for 10 ![:P](images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz"). Also possible then is nanpa pi luka en noka for 20. This does not damage to the philosophy of toki pona, seems to me, it works just like words as jan pona and tomo telo. It seems to me a cute way to prescribe numbers ![:P](images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz"). Maybe we can link other nanpa word combinations to other values...?I would love to hear your reactions.2006/11/23, [MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com) <[MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com)\
>:1. Since there are no distinct words for the numbers three and four, there shouldn't be a word for five, either, especially when that word already has a separate distinct meaning.  (And why "luka" for 'five'?  Why not "noka"?)jan Setepo / stevo --
