\[someday I will figure out what my hamfisted typing does that leads to thingsgetting sent\]Sewing is joining cloth together (there are other ways, of course but this isTHE way) so might be"wan len". A needle would then be "ilo pi wan len" and thread "linja pi wanlen" (I suppose asewing machine qwould be "ilo ilo pi wan len" - a mechanical needle).The characteristic of weaving (and knitting, crocheting, tatting and macrame'andprobably others)is that one-dimensional thread becomes two-dimensional cloth, so "kama lenlinja." Looms, needles,hooks and the like then are "ilo pi kama ken linja" and yarn/thread for thesepurposes "linja pikama len"We need some further words to sort the subtypes out.Embroidery and related arts are matters of drawing on cloth with thread (floss),roughly "sitelenlen linja" (or maybe "sitelen linja len" or even just "sitelen linja" or"sitelen len"). Needlesand thread follow in the patterns above.But what is a pattern for any of these? "sitelen pi..."?
