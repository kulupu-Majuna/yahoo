Looking at Glenn's translation I do agree it's much more straight-forward. I like his kennings as well. I'll start working on the Viking herald's speech and make a new translation. If I knew OE I'd translate straight from that, but heavily inflected languages and I don't get along. jan Eli On 5/17/07, John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\

OK, now that the situation is clearer. But you might have done bettwr to 1. use Glenn's trl ratherthan Berridge's (Glenn writes less like Yoda, that is deviates more from the OE word order --
which works in a highly inflected language, in ME bit so much) and 2. start with the Vikingherald's speech, which gives most of the approriate references and sets up the irony of theflyting. Without it, B seems to be saying something terribly inappropriate.---

>"toki e nimi wawa ni e nimi ike ni" Now what follows is specified as B's utternaces. (It is notclear who B is, of course, but now we know that he is an opponent of the pirates, not one of thembeing defied.) Maybe "sewi wawa e palisa" "thrust his spear upward" roughly.Ahah, "shield" "sike utala"? "pirate" is a misleading explanation here, since this is a landing operation, not a sea battle.

Not that I know how to say either. Somewhere here you use "sama" more orless as "for, instead of" and that looks promising. "poisoned" "pi ijo moli" (or "ko" or "telo"usually)

Or is this shifting speakers? But then, who is sina? And whosewords?Ahah again: This is addressed to the herald and gives him instructions. "toki pi jan ike o pana"etc.
> sina toki e ike nimi mi mute tawa kulupu sina.You say OUR evil words (nimi ike pi mi mute) to YOUR group. This looks backwards, unless he istalking (as was not apparent --
 it appears to be the pirates as a group) to a messanger and istelling him what he is to say to HIS group, i.e. the pirates.As above "o toki ...."
