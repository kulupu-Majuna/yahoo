> "olde timey weapons?"Our group desires this: You to take our poisoned spears and old swordsI mean the former "which kills bodies" above.Sina is referring the pirates, but specifically an earlier pirate whogave a challenge to the chief who is speaking to give tribute inreturn for peace. Brythnoth in return is saying that instead of moneyhe will give war.(Continuation of original: ...poisoned spears and old swords...)<snip

> sina wile kama sona kepeken palisa suli moli en ilo moli.
> Who is "sina"? Most of the people mentioned so far seem to already know how touse weapons.See above, and this sina problem is a great example of the ambiguityof toki pona. The pirate hasn't spoken at all during this. Both sidesdo know how to use weapons. Brythnoth is laying down an ultimatum.(Original line: ...with us must spear and blade first decide the terms...")You will come to know spear and sword.
