Chained "pi"s were condemnedstylistically, but Ithink that was when they were mainly possessives, not right groupers. Ofcourse, the fewer thebetter probably. Yes to "li" if this is a question, not a command (which wouldwant "o"). Thelong pirates bit may want "o" anyhow\[ I am not sure how to handle appositives(no clear cases).

Why not "kulupu mi li wile pana e palisa sukli utala samamani tawa sina"which is more direct and like the original. The pirates are not so much takingas being given. itappears.
