There is such a thing as a Conlang Relay: A starter text, in English, istranslated into aconlang, that translation is then translated into another conlang and so onuntil the last one istranslated into the first conlang again. Each translation is accompanied byEnglish version,literal and smooth. The point is to see how much of the original remains at theend of the processand where things go agley. tp was used twice in Conlang Relay 14. The resultsare atwww.conlang.info/relay14/ring\_d.htmlFor the second Language Creation Conference, a special relay was run, for thoseattending (orinterested in) the conference. No tp was in the original set, but during thedebriefing at theend of the conference, I did up a version, which the Relay Master has includedin his summary. Itis atdedalvs.free.fr/relay/summary.html
