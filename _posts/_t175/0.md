toki!For the next version of the booklet I need some short text examples(jokes, little poems, ...).My other plans:- learn more toki pona ![;-)](images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink")\- make the text of the booklet a bit shorter (sorry Pije ![;-)](images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink")\- fix the problem with the pictures in the booklet version- make a German version (far future)I there someone who use latex too? It is easy to learn (easier thanhtml), free and it is disposable for nearly all OS. The mostLinux/Unix distributions have it. Here is a version for M$-Windows:[http://www.miktex.org/setup.html](http://www.miktex.org/setup.html)
