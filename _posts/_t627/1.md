>ni li mi wan tenpo li toki e toki pona."This is a temporal one of me and speaking toki pona"? I suspect something is wrong here but amunsure what was intended so can't suggest corrections. ken la "tenpo nanpa wan la mi toki lon tokipona lo ni" Â or so "For the first time, I am speaking toki pona here" or "ni li toki mi pi tokipona pi tenpo pi nampa wan" (way too many "pi"s)My best guess is "This is my first time speaking Toki Pona."stevo
