This is great Sonja. Especially the feelings section. Some good ones to
think about in there.

Another easy section might be body parts (sounds morbid when I put it like
that).

luka
noka
palisa

sinpin
lawa
linje

lawa
nena

sinpin

mije

I'm sure there are many more, but that's a start. If you'd like, I'd be happy
to put together an HTML-formatted list for inclusion in that page. Just let me
know.
