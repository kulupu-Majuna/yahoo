You said: therefore I say "li lukin unpa" (looks sex = is sexy), Okay, man; say whatever you want. I'm just telling you how Toki Pona is actually spoken. We use "pona lukin," and although I don't recall seeing Marr use "unpa lukin", I see no reason why it wouldn't follow the same pattern.About "Latija"... Do you mean the nation Latvia? Remember that Toki Pona does not use the syllable "ti". If you're referring to Latvia, it might be better to say it Lawija. But then, I'm not very good at phonetics, so don't take my word alone.Talking about when "li" is needed, you said: OK. And after "mi mute", "sina mute", "sina en mi"?Yes, "li" is still needed in these circumstances. The "li" is used when the subject is something other than just "mi" or just "sina", and "mi en sina" is something other than just "mi" or just "sina".mi wile e ni: tenpo kama la mi kute e toki sina. --
 I want this: In the future, I hear your talking.Yeah, I was saying that I wanted to hear back from you.
