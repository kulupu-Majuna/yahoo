That would be great! I'd love to see an Esperanto translation. --
 However, unless you just genuinely want to translate them, I think that before you begin it might be wise to see if anyone who actually wants such lessons needs an Esperanto translation as a result of not being able to read English in the current lessons.But like I said, if you want to translate and don't care whether or not others might need a translation, then by all means I'd be thrilled to have a translation. --
 Otherwise, maybe you should post again to this message board, and ask (in Esperanto, of course) if anyone would like a translation.Make sense?mi tawa.jan Pije.
