I would be happy to translate the lessons for you.I can't read the last few Esperanto posts completely, but it seemslike there are quite a few people who'd like an Esperanto version ofthe lessons. Yay!So, if you're still willing to translate, that'd be good. Feel freeto translate the text as directly or as liberally as you'd like.However, I would like to make one request: I wrote the course withEnglish-speakers in mind. For example, I often said things like, "Ifyou only speak English...". Of course, such phrases would seem sillyin an Esperanto text; so, try to alter those to fit Esperanto or justremove them altogether.I can put the lessons up on my own Toki Pona site, or you can hostthem somewhere else on your own. Whatever is best for you.Also, I was wondering how exactly you want to translate it. Were youplanning on just typing up a translation and letting me HTMLize it,or did you want to type the Esperanto translation into the HTML fileas it is?If you want, I can send you the HTML files. They are the exact thingsas what you already see on my Toki Pona site. The only difference isthat the ones on my site have that dreadful Angelfire ad codeinsertion thing.jan Pije
