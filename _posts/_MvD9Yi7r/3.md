I don't think "esun" should be used to mean an "espace" or "world".  
We already have several words for different kinds of places: "ma",  
"tomo" and "lon".  
  
I thought that "esun" was supposed to mean a place where things are  
\*bought\* or \*sold\*. Maybe as a verb it would mean "to shop", "to buy"  
or "to sell".  
  
I'd like to see examples from Sonja for how "esun" would be used.
