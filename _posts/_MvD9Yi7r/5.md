Can I conclude that you all expect me doing this alone? ;)  
  
Anyway, except for a little part at the end of chapter 1 the stuff is  
demo-complete, so I recommend you to test out already. You can do that  
for example with the demo at http://tr.im/world\_of\_goo\_esperante (in  
properties/config.txt change eo to tp).  
  
When anything is ready, I will prepare a demo-package just for toki  
pona. And maybe the toki pona version will be included in the boxed  
version/updates to it. (Just maybe, but anyway you can play it, as  
told about before :))  
  
Questions? Remarks? Very welcome! :)
