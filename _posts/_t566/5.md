If I wanted to speak about any of the years between 1980 and 2030, I would just say something like "tenpo sike luka tu pini la ..." ("in 1999..."). This is very much in the spirit of toki pona.However, this relative system can only be applied in speech, or in texts that aren't to be read next year again. The case I was considering was a text on our wiki, which hopefully will still be read next year. My proposal was to refer to the year by mentioning how many years have passed since toki pona's publication.  This is more in the spirit of toki pona than the first system, but less in the spirit of toki pona than the second system. Given that the second system can't be applied here, I would propose to change the text so as to use this third system. sina mute li pilin e seme?jan Moku. Any specific number more than '5' is not in the spirit of Toki Pona: tu tu wan (i.e., no more than two "tu"s and a "wan").I prefer expressions such as "tenpo sike ni", "tenpo sike pini", "tenpo sike kama".  "Mute" can be used with these too.Toki Pona is inherently vague.  Trying to make it otherwise distorts the language.  But languages don't have spirits.What does "ika" in the subject line mean?jan Setepo / stevo
