>I take issue w/the whole "spirit of the language" idea. TP does notresist large numbers due to any feature of its grammar or "internalsense". Rather, it simply lacks the vocabulary because of arbitrarydecisions made by its creator. TP could easily incorporate highernumbers w/o doing any violence to its "spirit". Personally, I think itwould be a great improvement if it had words for "ten" and "hundred".It wouldn't make the language any less "Daoist" (and I've alwaysdisagreed w/this characterization of TP, despite whatever jan Sonjaclaims). Rather, it would simply make the language much more robust.TP is the best example I've seen of a conlang which can do so muchw/so little. If the objective is to make a language which can maximizecommunication w/a minimal lexicon, these two more words make good"economic" sense, IMHO.jan Pita
