> concept if speaking tp.Well, if I wanted to speak about the year 1887, maybe I would also use "tenposike 1887" in toki pona (read as "tenpo sike wan, luka tu wan, luka tu wan, lukatu"). However, this is not very much in the spirit of toki pona.If I wanted to speak about any of the years between 1980 and 2030, I would justsay something like "tenpo sike luka tu pini la ..." ("in 1999..."). This is verymuch in the spirit of toki pona.However, this relative system can only be applied in speech, or in texts thataren't to be read next year again. The case I was considering was a text on ourwiki, which hopefully will still be read next year. My proposal was to refer tothe year by mentioning how many years have passed since toki pona's publication.This is more in the spirit of toki pona than the first system, but less in thespirit of toki pona than the second system. Given that the second system can'tbe applied here, I would propose to change the text so as to use this thirdsystem.sina mute li pilin e seme?jan Moku.
