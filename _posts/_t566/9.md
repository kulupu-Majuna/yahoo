I don't know anything about Daoism nor do i care, butthe way i see tokiponan culture it consists of the simplest minimalmost essential concepts that are inherently human and likely to beshared by all human cultures through history. i imagine apredominantly oral, non-mechanised, family-group living off the landtype thing (i am avoiding the word "primitive" which can havenegative connotations though it doesn't have to).the problem we all face all the time, is to reconcile this with theuse of toki pona in our "modern", technological,global and largelywritten culture. to give in and import concepts from our culture intotp would be wrong imo. (i note the irony of saying that the Internetis "foreign" to true tp culture, although tp could hardly survivewithout it!)i feel that in a real tp society we would hardly be having thisdiscussion. If i needed to say 1987, I probably would say "tenpo sikepi kon tawa mute" (the year of the hurricane) and most people livingaround me (for whom a sudden hurricane in southern england in 1987would be a very memorable experience) would know what I meant. Butchances are I would seldom need to be that precise... in mostcases "tenpo pini" would do.tp should not be dictated by the needs of a wiki, a medium which isof itself not inherent to tokiponan culture. but for the purposes ofa wiki, "tenpo sike 1987" is clear enough. how do you say that? wellif i felt i would be understand if i said "tenpo sike nineteen eighty-seven" then i'd say that! After all it is a foreign concept (to tokipona), what's wrong with using a foreign word? If there was noforeign language (i.e. non-tp) i could use to express this foreignconcept then i would... eh... i would write "1987" in the sand andsay "tenpo sike ni"! ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")(We use "foreign" words to express "foreign" concepts in alllanguages all the time. The only arbitrary thing that tp does is thatit actively resists adopting these words into its own vocabulary. Idon't have a problem with THAT!)also, although I object to the concepts of 10 and 100 beingtokiponan, i do come across concepts occasionally which i thoughtought to be expressed in tp. In many cases they also make "economicsense" when it comes to expressing "the most with the least" but forme the main argument is that they are (ought to be) an essential partof toki pona culture. one such example is "pata". I can't understandwhy that was dropped. in a culture which is centred on the familyunit, "jan sama" just doesn't cut it!have you been reading my ramblings all the way till here? bloodyhell! you were not supposed to! I thought you would have got bored afew paragraphs ago. I'm only rabbitting on because I have some work iam supposed to do and I am looking for things to avoid doing it. buti have run out of things to say, and i have run out of things to sayabout what I have written, so i best get back to my work :)mi tawajan Sowelilili
