Both senses don't only "seem to bedifferent" but they wouldn't be present only in Toki Pona as differentexpressions, as other languages can also do that. I can't think ofother sure examples right now, but Latin immediately came to my mindwhen I read that message. In classical Latin the ablative case is usedfor the name of the language when in English (and other languages) yousay someone is talking \*in\* a language, while the preposition \_in\_ canbe used in Latin with the name of the language for the other sense.Later during the history of the language and the loss of thedeclension, the preposition \_in\_ was generalised for both senses, asthe Romance languages show.jan Loliko--
