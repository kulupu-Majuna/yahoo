We know that "talking in a language" uses "kepeken" but "this happens in alanguage" seems to be different, but also not obviously a case of inness.Perhaps rephrasing, e.g., "Verbs agree with their subjects in French" to something like "French verbs agree with their subjects" would work. Â In other words, instead of saying "X happens in language Y", say "X of language Y happens".jan Setepo / stevo
