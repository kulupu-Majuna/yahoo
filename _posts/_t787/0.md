This little poem was written in the "last but one" century (the 19º),Some poems of this unhappy author, Bécquer, are still very popular inSpain. In fact, several verses from his poems have become a kind ofidioms or proverbs.oko laso sina li lukin tawa mi la,sina toki e nimi ni: "toki olin li seme?"sina kin li toki e seme? a.toki olin li sama sina kin!My main problem here was to choose a word for "poetry"! In thecontext of this litle poem, I used "toki olin". What do you think?I think the translation keeps the original meaning and rhythm goodenough. Unfortunatley, the TP word order is so rigid, that there arenot many possible combinations.The original Spanish poem and a professional (not by me...) Esperantotranslation are here:[http://alinome.net/tokipona/tra_gabecquer.eo.htmljan](http://alinome.net/tokipona/tra_gabecquer.eo.htmljan) Mako
