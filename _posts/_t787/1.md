Gee, we don't have a word for poetry (there must be one somewhere, I judst don'thave it handy --
I hope). "toki olin" seems to be a particular kind of poetry, certainlyappropriate here. I'msorry we can't work the pupils in somehow but they just don't seem to fit in tp.The last linemight be punchier as just "toki olin li sina," mirroring the question better.---
