The original question was if it was 'correct' to utter 'mu jan' or 'a soweli' at all.  The modifier to the interjection says what the sound was like instead of clarifying who said it. (which of course can be argued) The original question was about replacing either "mu" or "a" with "a jan" or "mu soweli", thus eliminating (or merely avoiding) one of the words.I argue for keeping both words, since they have distinct meanings, with relatively little overlap.  jan Setepo / stevo
