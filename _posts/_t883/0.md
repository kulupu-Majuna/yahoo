Someone recently suggested using "mu jan" for "a" (or "a soweli" for "mu", I don't recall exactly which), but that doesn't really work."a" expresses emotion, any emotion."mu" is the sound an animal makes, possibly even a person, but there is no emotional implication.  Thus "a soweli" is an emotional utterance of an animal, virtually a contradiction in terms, whereas "mu jan", while it makes sense as what babies say, what's the normal sound a person makes?  I don't think there is one.  Everything is language or emotional expression.Let's keep "a" and "mu" separate.jan Setepo / stevo
