"a soweli" could be technical zo-ological jargon for "signaling" (that almost but not quite language-like behavior of some of the more social animals)ken la mi mute li kepeken e nimi ale tan "Onomatopoeia".moku kalama li  "jan jan jan".waso kalama li "ko ko ko"ilo kalama pi tomo tawa pi linja tu li "tu tu tu"jan lili pi kalama li "wawa wawa wawa"mi tawa,Matthew MartinOn 9/28/07, Helmut Voigt <[akesi_palisa@yahoo.de](mailto://akesi_palisa@yahoo.de)\

I would use "mu jan" to describe an animal-like scream or sound uttered by a human being while "a soweli" seems to be an emotional scream or sound uttered by an animal but is to understood as an expression of joy or fear, etc.  jan [ElumutuMorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://ElumutuMorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com) schrieb: In a message dated 9/26/2007 12:27:56 PM Central Daylight Time, [matt@suburbandestiny.com](mailto://matt@suburbandestiny.com) writes:
 The original question was if it was 'correct' to utter 'mu jan' or 'a soweli' at all.  The modifier to the interjection says what the sound was like instead of clarifying who said it. (which of course can be argued) The original question was about replacing either "mu" or "a" with "a jan" or "mu soweli", thus eliminating (or merely avoiding) one of the words. I argue for keeping both words, since they have distinct meanings, with relatively little overlap.   jan Setepo / stevo Wissenswertes zum Thema PC, Zubehör oder Programme.BE A BETTER INTERNET-GURU!
