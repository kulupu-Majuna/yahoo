What do you think?For me, the ilo sina pana... option is best, because it is clear that sina modifies only ilo, and obviously the end of the pi grouping is marked by li, so that tpers know e ni: nimi pali li kama ![8-)](images/smilies/icon_cool.gif "Cool") jan ElumutuAhah!? One or the otherof the last two wants "sina" to modify the whole preceding string and theother wants it to modify just "lipu sona." I assume the first of these is the job of the lastexample. But how do we speak that? It is hard to say since there is little about intonationcontour in tp (except that questions do not end on arising tone), let alone other suprasegmentals(here probably juncture, if the comma is meant to mean something like it purportedly means in English).
