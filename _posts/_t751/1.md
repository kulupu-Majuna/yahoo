There is no convention about commas; indeed, there is strictly speaking no needfor commas in tp,since there are no subordinate clausesm except the conditions, which are alreadyset off by "la."Notice that the tp is laready clearer than usual English, since both (all three?--
 I don't getthe difference that the third is pointing to) are likely to be said the same inEnglish.---

>> I think it's clear. What do you think?Ahah!? One or the other of the last two wants "sina" to modify the wholepreceding string and theother wants it to modify just "lipu sona." I assume the first of these is thejob of the lastexample. But how do we speak that? It is hard to say since there is littleabout intonationcontour in tp (except that questions do not end on arising tone), let aloneother suprasegmentals(here probably juncture, if the comma is meant to mean something like itpurportedly means in English).
