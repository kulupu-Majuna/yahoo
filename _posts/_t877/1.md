>"sike lili la" is very unclear: "under the condition of a small circle" Do youmean "a few yearago"? "sike suno lili pini" or some such. English is "Inli" and "kepeken" isprobably generallybetter than "lon", though this might e an exception. "nimi" are assumed to bein a language, so"toki" is redundant, unless the idea is to stress that he spoke them ratherthan, say, wrote them,but that also seems a given in this context. "ona ale" suggests who these allare has alreadybeen mentioned (anaphoric pronoun), here probably "jan ale" says it well enough.In the secondcase, "kepeken" is clearly preferable to "lon."
