He was famous.  Maybe he would have been ableto speak toki pona.  We will never know. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/science/10cnd-parrot.html?_r=1&oref=slogin](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/science/10cnd-parrot.html?_r=1&oref=slogin) Is there an better way to express irrealis in tokipona?  “ken la” is all I can think of so far. jan Mate Mawisin
