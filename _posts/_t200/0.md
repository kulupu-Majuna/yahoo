It's always fun to read books in Toki Pona, and beings as today,April 22, is Earth Day, I have put up a translation of Dr. Seuss'children's book "The Lorax": [http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/lorax/The](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/lorax/The) book is about a guy named the Once-ler who destroys a beautifulcountry and about the Lorax, who tries to stop the Once-ler. It has amore meaningful message than some other Dr. Seuss books (like How theGrinch Stole Christmas). The only thing I don't really like aboutthis book is that it casts capitalism in a very harsh light; but ohwell, it's still a good back even with that consideration.Keep in mind that hourly bandwidth for Geocities is very low. If morethan one person reads through the whole book within an hour, the sitewill shut down until the beginning of the next hour. Please havepatience. I will leave the book up for a week or two so that everyonegets to read it.jan Pije
