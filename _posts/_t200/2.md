Good idea. Thanks. The point about making the text rhyme is an interesting one. I wish it would be plausible to make the text rhyme in TP; but with so few words, that's impossible, just as it's impossible to translate every meaning expressed in the English version. ![:(](images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad") If you feel the urge, try posting the URL to the Lorax translation in about a week. All the Toki Ponans should be done reading it by then, so I won't be upset if the bandwidth runs out. Please mention what I said about the impossibility of rhyme and direct translations, though. jan PijeDo you Yahoo!?Yahoo! Photos: om/ph/print\_splash"
