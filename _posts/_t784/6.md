> No, instead of "pali e ni" two sense of making something happen.Right, much better, "kama" is more general, thanks.I wrote "ma li pali e ni: pipi li moku. sama la, ma li pali e ni: mimute li moku." but as usual, the original can have many translationsin TP:"She brings up/raise worms, the same way she brings up/raise us."For example, I could use "li kama suli" instead of "li moku". "moku"seems simpler and clearer to me.

I think "sin" isbetter than "telo" to reflect the aim of the original words. Colorsare not a good distinction in this case, because of the wide meaningof "jelo".jan Mako--
