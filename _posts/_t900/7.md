> taso jan LI moku e soweli tomo kepeken uta nena la ona li ijo sin.'moku' seems a little strong, maybe 'utala kepeken uta walo' (but Ilike 'uta nena'). 'ni li ijo sin ala' is a little clearer; it doesn'tsay "There is no news." 'ona' is hard to figure out (is it the man,the dog or the teeth, or the event); for some reason 'ni' seemsclearer (often associated with sentences, I suppose, though strictlyas obscure as o'ona').
