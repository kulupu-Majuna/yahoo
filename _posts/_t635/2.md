mi wile (e ni) Please, I would like (this/that)I don't know that it's necessarily a good thing, in a dictionarysetting, to add in the "Please" without explicitly noting that it isimplied through convention and not actually \*in\* the sentence.
>(Strings of words group left, except 1) at least two after pi form aunit within the left
>grouping, 2) words after prepositions form a unit 3) some phrases areinherently units,
>e.g., mute lili.)You may want to choose something other than a parentheses after thenumbers or around the whole thing because it reads:(String of words group left, except 1) ......which is very confusing.---
