>Hmmm. What did I have in mind? The point is that the first items (un...a) arevarious negations,none of them polar (for which English doesn't have a good word), but ala getsused for polars aswell as the broad negations and neutrals. So, the "and polar opposites" shouldbe over with thenegation markers. "With modifiers" then is in the comment section parallel tothe previous twoitems.
