I couldn't really figure out what you were suggesting in some parts of your past two replies, but here's my two cents' worth on one thing that you mentioned:You said you wanted to talk about a smooth place to sit on a rock.Why not just say that you'd like to stay on "that rock"? So you'd have: mi wile awen lon kiwen ni.And if you're not happy with not mentioning the smoothness, how about this?: mi wile awen lon kiwen ni. ona li pilin pona tawa monsi mi. --
 I want to sit on that rock. It feels good for my bottom.Maybe you're trying to be a bit too specific about describing areas.--
