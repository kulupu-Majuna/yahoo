There is no word for "place". You'll have to decide whether the "place" is a building or an outside area. If it's outdoors, use ma. If it's a building, use tomo. Then you can adjectives if you want. To say "That is fast":tenpo lili la ni li tawa mute.Time little (la) that (li) goes much. And you just flip it around to say that something is slow:tenpo mute la ni li tawa lili.Time much (la) that (li) goes little. --
