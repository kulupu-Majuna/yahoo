What do you think of "lon" for place?I'm thinking about if the place is for instance a corner of a table(calling it a "tomo" woudn't work) or a smooth spot on a rock tosit outdoors ("ma" is too much, maybe it could be a "ma lili"?).How about "everything has its place"? --
 "ijo ali li jo e lon pona"?Or something like that? I think "lon" works there maybe...I like your fast/slow for objects, still wondering if I'm on therighttrack for events (do I need the "pi" in "tenpo suno suli mi li kamapi tenpo lili"? Or is there a better way to say it altogether?jan Tepe---
