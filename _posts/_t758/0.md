> "kiwen lukin", "ken lukin" don't seem to catch 'transparent' either.I am not sure if I am right: Something that is "kule ala" must betransparent because colors are our perception of the reflected light.No color means no reflection, so the light does not stop at the "kuleala" thing; it goes though. But many transparent things already havecolor: They reflect part of the light: Transparency has degrees.Maybe we can change the point of view and think about light, notcolors:something (X) is transparent when..."suno li (ken) kama insa li ken weka""suno li (ken) tawa insa li ken weka""suno li tawa insa (X)""suno li open e X"...just an initial brainstorming.jan Mako--
