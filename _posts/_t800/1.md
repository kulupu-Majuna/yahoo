I will make the sourcefile downloadable from my site. It could be in the group file sectiontoo.It would be nice to join everything available using a kind of wikitool specially designed to build multilingual vocabularies. Anyoneknows such a web tool?Some time ago I collaborated about something similar with the BEMIpeople:[http://bemi.free.fr/biciklo/jan](http://bemi.free.fr/biciklo/jan) Mako--
