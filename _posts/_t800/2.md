I have a pair of Excel fles (tp-Eng and Eng-tp) that are working toward coveringeverythingavailable at the moment (I have about a year and a half of back stuff to gothrough yet, but haveeverything from standing texts (the lessons, for example) and the last year onthis list). Ipublish periodic updates and reworkings into something like official format fromtime to time(another one due this week, I think). Unfortunately, I have not been able toget these into aformat that will upload successfully (i.e., keep columns and lines) so all Ihave done is send thewhole mess to those who ask for it. I have some notes --
 which I would welcomesomeone with therequisite knowledge filling out --
 about translations into French, German andEsperanto (Spanishwould be most welcome, as would Russian and anything else that someone wouldlike to offer).---
