Alright everyone. I finished enough work on my site for it to beready for viewers. Currently there is a translations sections, anexperiments section, a chat, a message board, and a links page(mainly for any curious outsiders who stumble upon my page).The chat and forum should be used only for talk about or design ofmy ideas, translations, or experiments that will be hosted on mysite. As long as all who participate agree, then I'm going to behosting the TP writing system on my site. Of course, all credit willbe given to those involved in its development.So come on over and take a look! The adress iswww.tokipona.bravehost.com. I should be in the chat most of the daytoday.(Sorry I haven't been putting any Toki Pona in my messages, it'sjust difficult to discuss creating a writing system using only 118words)-jan Kowi
