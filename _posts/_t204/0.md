I was thinking is toki pona oligosynthetic?for example:jan pona = good entity/person = friendkalama musi = fun sound = song/musicsitelen tawa = moving picture = movieadd a ni to the end of any of these and you getthis friend / jan pona nithis music/song / kalama musi nithis movie / sitelen tawa nithis seems rather oligosynthetic, i would appreciate any opinions as i enjoyconversationsabout linguistic theory. if you dont know what oligosynthetic means, look it up:).jan pona mi o a! mi tawa.
