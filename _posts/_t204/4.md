But some may think a better word may have been"oligoisolating", claiming that "oligosynthetic" refers only tomorphology within a word, which "isolating" languages lack.[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/message/36However](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tokipona/message/36However), what is a "word"? Here a SIL writer attempts to define it:[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAWord.htmLinguists](http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAWord.htmLinguists) may have trouble telling words from phrases. I claimthat apart from the cop-out "that which is delimited by spaces inorthography", no clear universal definition of a "word" exists.A linguist working with only spoken Toki Pona may identify a "word"meaning friend and spell it 'yambóna' in her improvised orthography,with genitive form 'pyambóna'. Going based only on speech, howwould one determine that such utterances are in fact multiple twowords <jan pona
