Based on this example from jan Kipo in "NewA-R", o sina ale li jo e tenpo suno pona a Have a nice day!I'm changing PS rule P4 to allow imperatives with multiple subjects, in particular "sina ale":  from:P4 <Subject
> ::= "o" | <Nominal
> "li"to:P4 <Subject
> ::= "o" | <Nominal
> "li"      | "o" <Nominal
> "li"Does this cause any problems overall in the grammar?jan Setepo / stevo
