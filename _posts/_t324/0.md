toki!as the project of translating the tp lessons into spanish looks a bitasleep (for the moment?), how about putting the english version inwikibooks? do you think that it will be mere reduplication of info orthat both tp and wp would benefit from it? in the 2nd case, do youthink we could copy the current lessons directly, or we should betterwait for the updated ones?IMO, having them in wikibooks would make further translations mucheasier simply because of how wikis work.mi wile kute e ni: sina pilin e seme!mi tawa, bye!
