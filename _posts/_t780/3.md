> while the word following o should be a verb (imperative).Or anything you can use as a verb?"toki mi li ni" is right, isn't it? "ni" can be something said orsomething to be said. It means (depending on context, etc.) "my speakis this/that"So why not "toki mi o ni"?I don't see a \*gramatical\* difference.But maybe my point of view is influenced by the Esperanto "-u", usedboth as imperative and \*subjunctive\* \[Does "volitive" exists inEnglish? Is it the same?\].If in Toki Pona "o" is used only to order someone to do something,then my "toki mi o ni" is wrong, because I can not command mysentence to be anything: it wouldn't obey :-)jan Mako--
