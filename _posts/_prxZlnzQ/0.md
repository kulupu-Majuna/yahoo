toki! mi Lejanto! mi jan Pasila! That's all I can say in Toki Pona for  
now. I'm taking Pije's "o kama sona e toki pona lessons"  
<http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson0.html> and have  
already a few questions. Please be so kind and answer to me:  
  
1) I've tokiponized my name, Leandro (pronounced, in Portuguese,  
leh-AN-dro) to Lejanto (which I think should be pronounced le-JAN-to),  
according to the "Tokiponization guidelines" in  
<http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/learn/tpize.html>. Is it correct?  
  
2) And by the way, I've taken a look at the names of coutries in  
<http://www.tokipona.org/ma.html> and found out my country's name,  
Brazil, is "Pasila" in Toki Pona. Do you guys and girls know why  
"Pasila", not "Pasilo" or "Pasile" or anything else? And should I say  
PA-si-la (following the rule "the accent is on the first syllable") or  
pa-SI-la (following the tokiponization guideline "use the colloquial  
pronunciation that locals actually and commonly use" -- for  
Brazilians, and Portuguese speakers, say bra-ZEEL, not BRA-zeel)?  
  
3) Still on pronunciation and locations (I do want to speak Toki Pona,  
rather than write it, and teach it my four-year-old daughter), how do  
I say America's name, Amelika, and other names with more than three  
syllables? A-me-li-ka? a-ME-li-ka?  
  
I thank you all for the attention given.
