I just discovered 3 messages that remained unmoderated the last time. Sorry  
for the delay.  
  
The messages are from users who haven't yet been accepted permanently. That  
might be long time users who haven't posted a lot since the moderation  
setting change (sorry jan Ke).  
  
Again, I'm very sorry, and I hope you can forgive me for the delay.  
  
Your moderator,

Communication is essential. So we need decent tools when communication is  
lacking, when language capability is hard to acquire...

Only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible. I think it's  
in my basement... let me go upstairs and check.
