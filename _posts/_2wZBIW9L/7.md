Coming before the verb. As o indicates an imperative, it relates to  
  
the verb, not to the subject.  
This is interpretive, of course, and there is notoriously no umique solution, but in P4 'o' always relates to the subject.

Never heard about a hortative. And remember that you use here the way  
  
jan Pije clarifies the subject, not the essence of the construction.  
  
The essentional way it works is quite easy, but English essentially  
  
lacks that kind of constructions.  
Hortatives are for exhortation, not commanding but urging or suggesting. As noted, it is not clear that there is -- outside of some interpretation (grammar) -- an essence. I think the two points about 'o' (which could perhaps be reduced to one) are about as close as one can get.

English influence. This is how the English linguistic people classify  
  
them, but it's not true about all languages. In Esperanto, we express  
  
most nuances with all kinds of adverbs, whose meaning even can become  
  
conditional. (Example: Priparolante tion pliafoje mi ne refarus tion:  
  
mi toki sin lon ni la mi pali ala e ni)  
  
In toki pona we need to take the broadest meaning to be able to cover  
  
it all. Otherwise toki pona would be way too precise.  
So far as I can see, the meaning of 'la' is pretty broad, but within that, it serves various specific functions by use of specific constructions. Sequence, for example, seems to me to usually use temporal words, if marked at all. that is, it is not an obvious reading of mere conditionality. tp is not automatically precise, but it is not willy-nilly sloppy either. (I don't see the equivalence between the esperanto and the tp, the one being subjunctive and the other declarative (not that I know how to do a subjunctive in tp).)

It does come quite near to the intended meaning this way.  
Well, except that it appears to be general rather than specific.

You are thinking rather complex. You are right in that 'la' indicates  
  
a correlation, but in fact it is clear what kind of a correlation it  
  
is, and that's the modification we defined in your case as a  
  
conditional and some other things, and in my case as an adverbial  
  
phrase which as such can take many different roles.  
  
  
Well, language situations are complex and trying to unpack them is often detail work. tp seems to do correlations fairly explicitly, using 'la' to be sure but not alone. But this is all -- as with 'o' -- a mtter of interpretation and, of course, if the message gets through, the means are interesting only in retrospect. the problem was, initially, that the message did not get through (the the problemwas more with the (superfluous?) 'o' than with 'la'.
