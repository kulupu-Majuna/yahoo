That would be another exception, alongside of mi and sina without li.  
Furtheron, in the lessons of jan Pije at the point where he explains  
o, you can find for example "mi mute o ..." which is just like the  
same.

adverbial phrases are phrases(!) which, as an adverb, have influence  
on the whole phrase it belongs to. it's the only way to explain why  
'la' can have time modifiers as well as conditional phrases (or you  
should tell me an other catch-all way to see it) and it gives you a  
great deal of liberty in expression.
