jan Sewe o, toki!Without having "native" toki pona speakers, it will never be possible to confirmor falsify Sapir/Whorf's hypothesis. As a German interpreter of Arabic andEnglish interpreting at Berlin schools more or less difficult discussionsbetween teachers, parents and pupils of non-German origin, I dare say thatlearning toki pona first would not in the least make anybody unable to masterother languages soon after. I know dozens of Arab children who talk in goodArabic with their parents and good German with their teachers or nurses. So, Idon't think that learning toki pona first would be in any way disadvantageous.Besides,  toki pona is so easy that even a child of 1 1/2 years (maybe) couldeasily start to express him/herself better than using baby English/German/anyother language. If this assumption were correct, it might lead to revolutionarychanges in the views to speech-learning in early childhood. But without testing,we will probably never know whether toki pona is or is not the ideal tool for (linguistic) understandingbetween adults and small children.Just as not being misunderstood: of course, children have also be taught thenative language of their country before going to school. But at home, toki ponais "pona mute tawa mi".jan Elumutu jan\_sewe <[serge.g@laposte.net](mailto://serge.g@laposte.net)\

> jan ElumutuYour dream that people learn TP as their first language might get asymbolic interpretation - maybe you'd like everyone to have goodthoughts. Now, do you really think it would be a nice thing to do toraise children exclusively in Toki Pona - as this could make themunable to learn a more complex language?\[Non-text portions of this message have been removed\]
