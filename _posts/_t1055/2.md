Your suggestion seems to be echoing that ofsomeone else here who wanted a Toki Pona chatterbot...Speed is important because we're discussing a NaNoWriMo type evenwhere you write in the conlang of your choice, but in order to do thatwe need to set a goal of how many words someone would write in themonth.

Bythe way, are there so many people who are simultaneously fluent in both TokiPona and Latin? :)I didn't ask how long it would take to translate it. In fact Ispecifically said "not translate". I asked how long it would take towrite something that long in Toki Pona. Saying "200 words" doesn'tmean a lot to most people, so I provided a visual example of just howlong 200 words was.
