Long texts are really hard to understand.I always wondered whether that was inherent in the language or because i'm notfluent enough. i guess a bit of both.the short sentences actually make tp easier to grok, but the similar sounds andshort words make it a bit hard to read imho.That being said, a lot of my time writing tp is actually spent thinking abouthow to say things. it's just not as easy as translating into another languagebecause the concept of tp is so different. so i guess tp would be pretty bad insuch a test.i guess i'd take about half an hour currently (not really having activly used tpfor about a year).greets,Fossi--
