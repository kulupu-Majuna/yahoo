Hi,  
  
I want to start a topic that would be endless but would give some  
legitimity to toki pona.  
  
Here http://www.uld3.org/ and here http://mulivo.pbwiki.com/Words  
you will see to application of the Roget classification  
(here  
:http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Roget\_Thesaurus\_Classification),  
that summarize the basic needed words in any language.  
  
I think it would be a good idea to produce something similar for  
toki pona, or put it in "database", like other groups have (but how we  
do that?). I think filling it by posts would be too messy (about 1600  
words).  
  
Do you think it's a good idea?  
  
Personnally, I'm not confident enough in my skills to do it...  
  
:),
