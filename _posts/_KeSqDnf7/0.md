My website (including information on gj√¢-zym-byn, Toki Pona,  
and various other conlangs, and on the Esperanto Society  
for Metro Atlanta) will be down for some time tomorrow as  
I transfer my personal web page contents (hopefully with  
the same URL) from one residential DSL/phone line account  
to another. If all goes well and AT&T is telling me correctly,  
it will only be for a short time, but I suspect it may be some  
hours and if something goes wrong, it may be days.  
The conlang sections of my pages (excluding Esperanto  
information) are mirrored at  
  
http://archives.conlang.info/attic/  
  
If you have bookmarks, or especially if you have links  
in your own website, to any URL beginning:  
  
http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/i/jimhenry1973/  
  
now would be a good time to change them to use  
the permanent URL, starting:  
  
http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/  
  
Currently the www.pobox.com URL redirects to the  
bellsouthpwp.net URL, and it will probably do so  
after tomorrow, but if I am informed incorrectly and  
I wind up not being able to use the same URL  
on the new phone account promptly after cancelling  
the old one, I may take the opportunity to switch  
to some other webhosting service, perhaps  
googlepages. Feel free to email me with suggestions  
about free and low-cost webhosting services.  
In any case http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/  
will, once the site is back up whether at  
the bellsouthpwp or some other host, redirect  
to the actual current address.
