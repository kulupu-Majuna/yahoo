Hello! I'm new to Toki Pona. When I first saw the idea it seemed absurd,but I'm discovering that it is usable, although long-winded.My question is, how does Toki Pona handle a sentence that uses a transitiveverb, but the subject is unknown? I'm thinking about a sentence that inEnglish would be put in the passive voice, or in Esperanto would use 'oni'.I'm translating something that uses a Japanese intransitive verb of thistype, and I can't use 'jan' in this context because a person isn't theactor.Thank you for making such an interesting language!Shihali Ramichu
