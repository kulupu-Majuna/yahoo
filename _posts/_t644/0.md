jan Sonja asked for a real example of this complex pi structure so asto render an opinion on it and I finally came up with one:jan utala li moli e jan lili pi meli pi kulupu miconceptually this isjan utala li moli e jan lili pi (meli pi (kulupu mi)I am sure that there are other ways to reword this but the point of myposting it as it is is to ask if it is valid toki pona in its currentform. The rules say that that you should not be able to put pi beforea single word but since that first pi is really talking about theconceptual grouping of "meli pi kulupu mi" not just meli it seems tome that it should be acceptable.ni li pona tawa sina?---
