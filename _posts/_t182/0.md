I know that there aren't many others like me from the States that areinterested in Toki Pona, but, anyhow, tomorrow is Thanksgiving herein America.Thanksgiving was first celebrated by the Pilgrims to thank God foreverything they had in the New World. Today, we all get together andeat turkeys and tons of other food until we get sick fromovereating. :)Anyways, I made two Thanksgiving comics in Toki Pona. They are bothabout turkeys dying the day before Thanksgiving.[http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/image/thanks.htmljan](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/image/thanks.htmljan) Pije
