I should've mentioned this in my last email, but I didn't think of ituntil afterward.I encourage you to learn about the Innocence Project, especially ifyou live in the USA. The Project is dedicated to overturningconvictions that were made years ago before DNA testing was widelyavailable. With the new technology that DNA testing allows, theProject has helped hundreds of innocent prisoners be set free.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_ProjectIf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_ProjectIf) you use Facebook, add the "Causes" application, and you can add theInnocence Project as a cause that you support. Look at my Facebookprofile if you want to see how it looks.mi tawa.Pije
