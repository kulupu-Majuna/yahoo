toki!i liked corey's idea about korean syllabary (although i better finishlearning the toki pona lessons before i even try to memorize thesymbols) so i made a little gadget to write toki pona in hangul (andnow, posting this, i have discovered that dominique had already donethe work before -and better than- me). anyway, here it is:[http://www.tobareinne.com/misc/llengua/tokipona/hangul-Vkbd.htmlit%27s](http://www.tobareinne.com/misc/llengua/tokipona/hangul-Vkbd.htmlit%27s) a bit ms-internet-explorer-centered but i have tried it withmozilla firefox 0.9.2 and works ok (except for the "clipboard"button, but it's not a big annoyance).btw, it's only one file so anybody can download it in order tomodify, correct, improve it, etc.your criticisms are welcome.mi tawa, bye!arinarin---
