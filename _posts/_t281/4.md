> pona.toki! toki pona sina li ike ala! :pFrankly, here are my two cents.We did have a toki pona project to make a completely new writingsystem, but it failed, because the latin script was already perfect.Besides, many languages in the world now use the roman alphabet.Hangeul is just unofficial. I make a claim that toki pona is sosmall, that you can write it in almost any writing system, of course,with modifications ![;)](images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink").I myself thought that Hangeul was also perfect for toki pona (since Iused it for my diaries), and introduced that to toki pona, and thatgot some development. But I think that the goal of toki pona isvagueness in simplicity. Since the hangeul script for toki pona isunofficial, you can modify it to your own liking whatsoever! But tome, I like to leave them all in hangeul and depend on contextualclues. Like if you see jan, and then another word after it that isnot an official word, you know it's a name; same with ma!I'd rather make it all look uniform and elegant rather than payattention to the subtleties that already can be picked up by context.But then again, if that doesn't work with you, change it! an-yeong! :Djan Ke.
