> I would say:
> ona li jan pona mi = she's/he's my friend
> ona li jan pona = he/she is a good personni li pona ala tawa mi. toki sina li sama ni:"ona li soweli tomo mi" = "it is my pet""ona li soweli tomo" = "it is a house animal"Your suggestions look like idioms, I think."ona li jan pona mi" can mean "she's/he's a good person 'for/relatedto' me" too.And "ona li jan pona" can mean just "he/she is a friend".I don't see the relation between the possesive and the change ofmeaning. That would be an idiom.Maybe you think that when you say "friend", you usually mention alsothe other person: You don't say "he is a friend", but "he is X'sfriend" or "he is a friend of X". That's right, but I think that isnot a reason to narrow the meanings in TP.jan Mako--
