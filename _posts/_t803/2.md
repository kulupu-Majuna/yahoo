Well, I have notjhing against idioms, but in tis case I think there is anotherinterpretation,namely that the personal pronoun (or more) provides a context in which :frien:is the more likelymeaning (as "tawa mi" would for the othre reading). The bare form is still opento bothinterpretation interpretations (as, of course are the extended forms)but theodds for the bareform (other things being equal) is about even while the longer forms are shiftedstrongly in oneway or the other.---
