conceptual thought is bad? Oh well, I mostly work on autopilot anyway.Several of the people on this list use the word "concept"in ways that seem odd to me --
 not sure if they'renot native speakers of English, or speakers ofdialects other than mine. I would tend to usethe word "abstraction" in most of the contextswhere e.g. jan\_sewe was using "concept" inrecent posts. To me "conceptual thought"is a pleonasm, like "archaic old things" or"mnemonic memory" or "pulmonary lungs"."conceptual" is the adjective form of "concept"which is a fancy word for "a thought", not necessarilyan abstract thought, which is the kind of thoughtthat I think jan\_sewe and some other toki ponaspeakers think that toki pona discourages --
 notsure if I agree with them there, either. It seemsto me that e.g. "soweli" is more of an an abstractionthan concrete terms in other languages like "dog","kinkajou", "marmoset" etc.; "pipi" more abstractthan "bee", "junebug", "firefly", etc. (On the otherhand "soweli" and "pipi" are less exact and technicalterms than their closest equivalents in English,"mammal" and "insect" --
 the latter have connectionsto scientific ideas about evolution and taxonomythat aren't connoted by the toki pona terms.)---
