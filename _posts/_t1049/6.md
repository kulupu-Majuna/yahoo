Each TokiPona word is a concept in itself, but it's often difficult to understand what aToki Poka speaker means whenever he uses one of them, or a combination of them.Whenever you say soweli - or soweli pona - in general you mean 'cat', 'dog','horse', but rarely 'mammal'!Maybe Sonja has conceptualised the notion of mammal by means of soweli, but TokiPona speakers aren't being conceptual whenever they use it! And you can't justsay 'sona pi toki pona' and hope your reader will understand 'tokiponology', aword that doesn't even exist in English...But sometimes I do wonder if Sonja really invented Toki Pona alone: it lookslike she might have benefited from conversations with a few guys like you... ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
