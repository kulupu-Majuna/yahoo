I've finished translating Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, and I've alsotranslated the Shahadah.Both translations can be found athttp://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/text/tokisewi.htmlIf you're unfamiliar with these texts and their significance:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mounthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShahadahFYI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mounthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShahadahFYI): The banner at the top of the page is Abraham after God tells himthat his descendants will be as numerous as the stars.
