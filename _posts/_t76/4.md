with fewer features and more simplicity?toki poni favors having lots of short sentences rather than a fewlonger ones. Why make an exception for relative clauses?The only good example I can think of is this: The man who hit the other man was bad.I think the best translation for this in toki pona is: jan li utala e jan. jan ni li ike....which fails to specify which man --
 if not both --
 is ike. (Somemight rashly say that, contextually speaking, you can tell which manis bad, because he's the one who hit the other one, and hitting isbad. Bad people can still be hit, though.)I think it'd be possible to indirectly specify the correct subject,perhaps like "jan utala li ike", or "jan nanpa wan li ike", but Ithink the normal way to do it is to push the specificity into thefirst sentence. Like, say, jan suli li utala e jan ma. jan suli ni li ike.In other words, give each man more of a handle than just, "a man."~Iwa
