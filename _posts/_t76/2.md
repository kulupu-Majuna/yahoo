Has anyone considered adding relative clauses to Toki Pona?Obviously one wouldn't copy the complex European model, but there areother, simpler ways of doing relative clauses, one of which might fitwith the nasin pi toki pona. I recommend Comrie's survey, of whichthere is an on-line summary in Esperanto, if you don't have access tothe book: [http://www.bertilow.com/rilataj/For](http://www.bertilow.com/rilataj/For) example, one could use something like:mi lukin e jan ke ku open e lupa.mi lukin e lupa ke jan open e ku.jan ke ku open e lupa li lukin e mi.lupa ke jan luken e ku li open.Or the same with "ona" instead of "ku", which would mean adding onlyone new word ("ke") and copying Persian.
