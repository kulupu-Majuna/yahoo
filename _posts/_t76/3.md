The concept of relativeclauses by itself is already complex, because it allows nestedphrases; look at what phrases we Germans like to build, and thenyou'll know why such things are ike.BTW: In your proposal it seems that adapt the idea, that in a"ku"-phrase the "li" is omitted. Was this accidental or does it havesome deeper meaning?If "li" is to be omitted, then you might get problems in seeing, wherethe attributes of the "subject" end, and where the "verb" starts.If "li" is not to be omitted, seeing the construction of the phrasegets quite difficult: "jan ke ku li nasa li suli li pona" might be"the person, which is crazy and tall, is good" or "the person, whichis crazy, is good and tall". Of course this problem could be solved byadding constraints on relative clauses, but this would not be overlypona.DniQ.
