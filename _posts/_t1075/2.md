Since I have never figured how to translate excel into something that looks goodon the web, my two dictionaries (and sketches from others for French, German andEsperanto) are still just in my box and those of them what I have sent them to. If you can do the conversion, you are welcome to the material, which isadmittedly in a rather out of date state.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_From: daraffa <[aikidave@gmail.com](mailto://aikidave@gmail.com)\
