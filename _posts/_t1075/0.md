toki!I've built a preliminary English to TokiPona database from thedictionary posted on the main site.Feel free to download it and expand it as needed.Hmm. I just realized I misnamed the file. Oh well!You can find it at: [http://www.tassano.org/TokiPona2Eng.tabIt%27s](http://www.tassano.org/TokiPona2Eng.tabIt%27s) plain text, tab-separated fields. Should import into your favoritedatabase manager. This version uses Macintosh line endings (linefeed)but I can make one with Windows endings (CR/linefeed) if this posesdifficulties.Sorry for the English post...jan Miki
