But note, "sina ala" modifies the wholepreceding bit "kama joijo" at least, whereas you want it to modify just "ijo". So "kama jo pi ijo pisina ala." thenI'd leave out the "sina" (partly because I am not sure how to do appositives --
two expressionsreferring to the same thing in the same grammatical place).

Or,as noted, "kute etoki/nimi pi jan ni"
