This is pretty archaic English I'm translating so the structures are interesting to study. So I see two suggestions: jan AJK li toki e nimi ni: sina o kute e toki pi jan ni (You listen to our speech!) jan Elumutu li toki e nimi ni: jan ike pi tomo tawa telo o kute e toki pi jan ni. (Pirates, (Bad people who travel over water) listen to our speech!) This particular English sentence is a peculiar turn of phrase that I don't hear much in English. It might be better to leave it simpler like these. jan Eli  On 5/11/07, John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\

But note, "sina ala" modifies the whole preceding bit "kama joijo" at least, whereas you want it to modify just "ijo". So "kama jo pi ijo pi sina ala." thenI'd leave out the "sina" (partly because I am not sure how to do appositives --
 two expressionsreferring to the same thing in the same grammatical place).

Or, as noted, "kute etoki/nimi pi jan ni"
