Yeah, mate, the site is down.If you want the Toki Pona dictionary, I have a make-shift copy of it up on my own Toki Pona webpage, which is here: [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/index.htmlThe](http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/index.htmlThe) dictionary is in the "Learning" category. If you would like to skip that front page of my TP webpages (which is the link I just gave) and go straight to the page with the dictionary, go here: [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/learn/dict.html--
