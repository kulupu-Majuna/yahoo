Somebody suggested removing the words "uta" and "oko" and replacingwith "lupa toki" / "lupa moku" and "sike lukin". This seems like avery valid argument and smart way to reorganize the words, but I don'tknow if it's a bad idea to remove old words like these. Any opinionsor thoughts pro or con?If you want to go that way, consider these:1) soweli = \*animala suwi akesi = \*animala pi suwi alakala = \*animala telowaso = \*animala kon(\*animala could be replaced by "soweli" (thus creating no new word), whose meaning would be expanded to cover all the others in the general case.)  \*animala/soweli would then mirror "kasi".2) Opposites can be given as a single word with one of two modifiers meaning "one way" and "the opposite way".  Since both of the words would have a modifier, this avoids the favoritism inherent in Esperanto "mal-" words, e.g., "dekstra" ('right(hand)') vs. "maldekstra" ('left(hand)').  If \*wana means "one way" and \*opo means "the opposite way", then all the pairs of opposites (and some unpaired words) can be given using fewer words.  If one word of the pair of opposites is used for the base word, it can be either one; someone would have to decide which to use (maybe the more frequent of the two?).  The base word could be used as the abstract term for which the opposites are the extremes.  If "pona wana" is 'good' and "pona opo" is 'bad', then "pona" alone could be 'goodness'.  "pona seme" would ask for which kind of "pona": wana or opo.Thus,pona/ike
