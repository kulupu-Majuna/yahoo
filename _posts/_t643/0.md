Somebody suggested removing the words "uta" and "oko" and replacingwith "lupa toki" / "lupa moku" and "sike lukin". This seems like avery valid argument and smart way to reorganize the words, but I don'tknow if it's a bad idea to remove old words like these. Any opinionsor thoughts pro or con?It's reasonable to reduce those words to more basic, but still simple, phrases, but what of other words like the ilo/kepeken pair? Â They already mean basically the same thing, so one of them (I would choose kepeken) can be removed.jan Setepo / stevo
