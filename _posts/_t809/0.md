I made a Toki Pona movie poster for the new movie "28 Weeks Later."The poster is athttp://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/image/poster28wklater.htmlThe text that was translated:WARNING! = O LUKIN!MAINTAIN THE QUARANTINE = O AWEN E WEKA PI JAN JAKIRetranslating back into English, the TP text roughly says "Maintainthe absence of the infected."DEADLY FORCE WILL BE USED TO PROTECT THIS AREA = MI MUTE LI WILE WEKAE JAN JAKI TAN MA NI LA MI MUTE LI KEPEKEN E WAWA MOLIBack into English, the TP text roughly says "If we need to remove theinfected from this area, we will use deadly force."I saw this movie at the theater, and I liked it very much. I encourageyou to consider going to see it, especially if you like horror movies,saw 28 Days Later, and/or want to see London get firebombed.
