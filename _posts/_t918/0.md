A subscriptionrequest message has been sent. If this is contrary to your wishes,please send a mail to [admin@gmane.org](mailto://admin@gmane.org) saying so, and the list will beremoved from Gmane.Gmane is a mail-to-news portal that never expires its messages. Ittherefore also functions as a mailing list archive. It's abi-directional gateway, but Gmane verifies that its users' emailaddresses are valid before passing the messages through thenews-to-mail gateway. (Groups can also be made "read-only", whichmeans that Gmane won't forward any messages at all to the mailinglist.)Gmane can encrypt addresses to make address harvesting difficult, andheeds X-No-Archive and related headers.If you wish to import older archives into Gmane, send a message tothe Gmane administrators with the URL of a Unix mbox archive of themailing list.In partnership with The Mail Archive, messages will be archived onthat service as well. This provides redundancy across two archivalservices.The following parameters are set for this mailing list: \* Newsgroup name: gmane.culture.language.tokipona \* Mailing list address: [tokipona@yahoogroups.com](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.com) \* The gateway is bi-directional \* Address encryption is off \* Spam detection is on \* The list is described as: "Discussion of and in Toki Pona, a minimalist constructed language" \* News URL: news://news.gmane.org/gmane.culture.language.tokipona \* Web URL: [http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.culture.language.tokiponaThis](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.culture.language.tokiponaThis) newsgroup will be created when the first message from themailing list arrives.For more information about the Gmane project, go to<URL: [http://gmane.org/%3E.For](http://gmane.org/%3E.For) more information about The Mail Archive, go to<URL: [http://www.mail-archive.com/%3E.This](http://www.mail-archive.com/%3E.This) request was handled byLars Magne Ingebrigtsen <[larsi@gnus.org](mailto://larsi@gnus.org)\
