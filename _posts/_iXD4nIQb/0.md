Does that apply to conlangs created by other people? I said at LCC3  
I'd do the Shema in Esperanto and Toki Pona as well as gzb; here's  
Hillel's version of the Golden rule in those languages:  
  
Tion, kio malagrablas al vi, ne faru al via proksimulo.  
  
pali ijo li ike tawa sina. o pali ala e ni tawa jan ante!  
  
(I'm open to suggestions from other Esperanto or Toki Pona  
speakers on the list about improving those. In particular,  
I wonder if "aliulo" or "kunulo" might be more apt than  
"proksimulo" (I chose the latter because it's used in related  
contexts in the Esperanto translation of the Bible, e.g.  
the parable of the Good Samaritan), and whether the  
two sentences in my Toki Pona version might should  
/ could be joined into one with "la". I'm disinclined to  
do so because of the length of the first clause.)
