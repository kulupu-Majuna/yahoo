Hi everyone, it's me Pije.Today I moved to the University of Georgia. I finally got the internetconnection going; unfortunately, the IRC ports are blocked here. Itried to get in and never could, and I even asked a tech support guyabout it.I can no longer get into the TP chat room. :(I was wondering if it might be possible to come up with some alternateplace. Maybe on Yahoo! or make one using Javascript.Of course, if the people who use the room often (Lament, for example)don't like the idea of moving the chat room, it doesn't have to bemoved. But I will never be able to come by anymore, which would makeme really sad.I'm sorry for the trouble that this will (potentially) cause. If therewere a way around it, I would gladly do it. But I don't have that option.jan Pije
