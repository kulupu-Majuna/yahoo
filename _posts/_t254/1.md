I discovered that I can connect to DALnet if I use port 6663. Perhapsthe room could be moved from Freenode to DALnet? Anyway, I'll bewaiting around in 'tokipona' on DALnet, although I'll be away most ofthe time. Please come by if you go to the Freenode chat often. We cangive the room on DALnet a try and see how it is.jan Pije
