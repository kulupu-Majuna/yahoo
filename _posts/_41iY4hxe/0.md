Michael Jackson died last month. He was a good dancer and a singer. His service was held in Los Angeles. His body was in a gold casket. Many important people spoke at his service. His brother sang a song. The people were sad. His 3 children were sad. His friends wore one glove. The police are still investigating (lukin) why he died.
