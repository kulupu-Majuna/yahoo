toki!So this person came to #tokipona or irc.freenode.net (which is whereyou should go too - you know you want to!) and asked if it is possibleto express complex things in Toki Pona.Of course it's possible! Usually with a single word: "ike" :)He challenged me to translate two sentences on a rather complexsubject, which I did.As an excercise, I challenge tokiponers to try and translate it back.People who were in the chatroom at the time are barred fromparticipation, naturally :)Here's the toki pona text:jan li wile ante e lon pi jan ale la ona li jo e ilo tu wan.ona li ken kama sama e jan lawa, li pali e ijo pi jan lawaona li ken pali e lipu toki lawa sewi.ona li ken ante e insa pi jan ale pi tenpo kama.Post your ..err.. guesses here, or, if you're too embarassed, justsend them to me. Note: If your translation is nothing like theoriginal, you will make me look like a fool (an added bonus) :)Have fun! pona!
