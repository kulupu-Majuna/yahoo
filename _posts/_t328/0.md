Hi! I just discovered Toki Pona today. I have been interested inconlanging for a wile, but only now have I found a satisfying,simple language with actual speakers! I have only just begun tolearn toki pona, but I would be glad to translate the lessons intogerman (my father is an american, but my mother is german and I havelived in germany all my life). I am only 14, so I am probably toyoung for the job, but I could try? My german spelling is muchbetter than my english spelling(german and english not capitalisedbecause of lazyness), and my mother could prove-read the translation(my parents are both translators). So, if you want to give me achance, just tell me which lessons I should translate and I'll start.
