I'm new to Toki Pona...it seems that this beautiful language hascome alive...I use the analogy of the children's story ofPinoccchio...he was just an artificial, wooden boy until he becamealive...then he became a real boy. My constructed language, Xhara,is like that. I consider that when it started to change throughbeing used by me, it became a "real language". Maybe Toki Pona ismoving in that direction. It seems to have a following. Xhara, onthe other hand, is used by only me..., although it's not hard, it'sdifferent, and no one has been brave enough to try to learn it.To answer the question, "Once one has created or tokiponaised a loanword, how does one then inform or register the word for others touse? " Maybe any changes or loans should be okayed by Sonja first,since she is the creator of Toki Pona. I guess for Xhara, I wouldlike the same. This site would be a good place to register anychanges.
