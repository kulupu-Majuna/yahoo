>From what I could understand, Alexandre seemed to be suggesting that theTokiPona vocabulary is not suitable as an international (auxiliary)language. He seemed to be suggesting ways that we could "improve"TokiPona in that direction.I could be wrong.My understanding is that TokiPona was never intended to be a full IAL,and that moving it in the direction of being a "useful" IAL wouldactually run counter to its philosophy.Kevin
