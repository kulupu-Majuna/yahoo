Hey Philip,Thanks! I'll take your comments to heart, I found a lot of them veryhelpful. I haven't worked too much on this idea since the posting,since I've been commissioned to design a web site for my youth groupand only have 13 days to complete it. Being a perfectionist, I willnot stop working until the site is brought to a level that meets mystandards (Do I sound haughty here? Not intentionally at least).Anyways, I'll report again when I finish. I'm looking forward toanother review!-jan KowiP.S. A tengwar system has already been devised, see Pije's site([http://www.geocities.com/tokipona](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona))
