I'm interested in Toki Pona mainlybecause it makes me think differently.The trick of the words is that their meanings are much more broad thanyou're used to. You can probably memorize some definitions for the118 words fairly quickly, but to get the sense of them will takepractice.I think the main difficulty in learning Toki Pona is in learning thatyou can't just translate things word-for-word. You have to knock itdown to just one idea at a time and let go of specific details whichyou now take for granted.

Igained fluency in Esperanto mostly by chatting online via InstantMessenger then attending local Esperanto club events. I'd love it ifI could do that with Toki Pona but ...hmmm, I wonder how I'd go aboutfinding out if anyone near me is interested in Toki Pona.Anyway, I wouldn't worry about "fluency" just yet if I were you. Readthe tutorial. Try chatting online. Read the tutorial again. Chatonline some more. See how you like it.Rick
