(sigh) I don't think he "gets" the whole point of TokiPona.You're not supposed to encode your English-speaking thoughts into TokiPona words and grammar. No, you're supposed to take a step back fromwhat you would say in English and dig out the real root of it, whichyou then put into Toki Pona. Do you really need the specificmeanings? Do you really mean what the words seem to say? RIP OUT theidioms. SIMPLIFY.That's what I think it's for, anyway.Rick
