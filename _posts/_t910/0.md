Hi people, I first heard of toki pona yesterday, found and bookmarkedall the net resources (I think), and I want to learn it.I'd like to ask you some questions that probably have no good answers,sorry, just trying to get a feel of what I'm in for, how much time toallocate, and what outcomes are reasonable to hope for.With only 118 words and a handful of logical pattern restrictions, itlooks like something I should knock over in a few days ofdetermination, or a dozen short evening sessions. Am I kidding myselfhere?After finishing the tutorial and feeling confident with all of thematerial, what happens next? How do you set about turning a mentalcatalogue into fluency or comfortable everyday use? Or does it just...happen?
