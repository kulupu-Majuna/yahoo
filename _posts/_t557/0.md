If "e" is moved to the list of prepositions (and no other POS), then P9 can be deleted and P8 becomes:P8 <Verb-Phrase
> ::= <Verb
> \["ala" <Verb
>\] \[<Modifier
>\*\]      (The verb after "ala" is the same as the one before "ala".)Changing P1 and P2 to reduce duplication results in:P1 <Sentence
> ::= <Interjection
>      | \[\["taso"\] <PreSentence
> "la"\] \[Vocative\] <Subject
> <Predicate
>P2 <PreSentence
> ::= <Nominal
>        | <Sentence
