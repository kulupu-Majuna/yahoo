When did you download the one from my site? Until about two weeks ago, I did have a messed up version of the font on there without realizing it, but I fixed it and put up another version of the font that works for me (even after uninstalling the font and then readding it from the ZIP on my page).If it was a while ago when you downloaded it, try to download it again.If that doesn't work, keep in mind that the font is a TTF. If you're using something other than Windows, you might need a convertor to make it work for whatever operating system you use.PijeDo you Yahoo!?Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo! HotJobs
