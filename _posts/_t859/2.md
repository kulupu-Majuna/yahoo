>"jan ni" anu "ijo ni"This would remove "ona" from the list of exceptions to the exceptions of when not to use "li":  The rule is to use "li".  The exceptions are when the subject is a bare pronoun.  The exceptions to the exceptions are when the subject is "ona" or "ni".  I still think "mi", "sina", "ona", and "ni" should be treated identically.  If one is an exception to the "li" rule, they should all be, and for the same reason.jan Setepo / stevo
