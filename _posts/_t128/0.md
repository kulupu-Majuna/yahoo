To the very few (and by few, I mean about two or three) who actuallycome to the TP chat room, I just wanted to drop a line and say hello.England is quite fun, but it's much, much colder than I hadanticipated. I even brought a pair of shorts. Ha!The castles and such are neat, despite the aristocratic overtone.Saying, "You come from Mr. Bush?" some Middle Eastern fellow insultedme for being an American and not being able to count British coinsvery well, but other than that, everyone has been either friendly orindifferent here.Well, I don't intend to send anymore e-mails; just checking in, youknow. I'll see you all soon.--
