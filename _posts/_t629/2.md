Why is li a nominal marker and not a verb marker?  For some reason my small brain has decided that "li" means "here comes the verb".  When I hear "li", I never think "ah, that was the subject"Why does toki pona need a new verb category to deal with "lon/tawa"? For example, why the P11 say <Vx

>(1) = \["ala" + repeat of the entity immediately before it\], and may be applied only once.Both of your suggestions are good.  I didn't think of a null copula.  What would the rule look like?I did think of a transformation for reducing "tawa tawa" and "lon lon", but decided against it.  I'm not sure why.jan Setepo / stevo
