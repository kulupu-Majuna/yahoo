mi tawa tawa tomo pali .  So it looks like the extra tawa could be dropped without loss of meaningmi tawa tomo pali.  This is okay, I can live with this. However, since tomo pali  is \*not\* a modifier to a verb, what is it?  It isn't taking "e", so it isn't the object.  It isn't adverb--
 I don't office-ly go, I don't go "in the manner of an office" Look at this:  I drunkenly went to the office.  Where am I going to put drunken so that it doesn't get mixed in with "the office"? mi tawa nasa tawa tomo pali.  Some how it just feels like I'm going to need to bring that extra tawa back to life or else I get this: mi tawa nasa tomo pali.  Putting a "pi" in there doesn't help because I'd get\* mi tawa nasa pi tomo pali, which doesn't make any sense to me. (maybe I stagger in an office-like fashion?) Similar situation for dealing with "is at/exists at" mi tawa nasa, jan Matthew MartinMaybe a transformation that "tawa tawa" becomes "tawa", but that two "tawa" separated by something else cannot be reduced.Can anything come between two "tawa" in a sentence?jan Setepo / stevo
