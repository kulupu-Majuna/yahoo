We have to askt Pije first. I made only the layout with latex.Everybody can download the pdf file to print it out.I'll make the text a bit shorter and then I'll make a booklet in pdf.You can print two sides on one A4 page and then you can print on theother side. This booklet is very handy and good for learning.[http://rowa.giso.de/toki-pona.php](http://rowa.giso.de/toki-pona.php)\
