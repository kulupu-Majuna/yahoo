I mean, I always wanted to havea real book in my hands about Toki Pona. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") I heardonce about a publishing site that works where theyactually publish the book each time someone orders it.

Anyone have the address?Best wishes,Chuck=====Learn a cool language for free![http://www.lernu.net/__________________________________________________________________Gesendet](http://www.lernu.net/__________________________________________________________________Gesendet) von Yahoo!
