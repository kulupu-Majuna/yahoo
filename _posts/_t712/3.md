 As for the official line on when to use "e," the usual story is that "e" is not usedif the referent is not affected by the action of the verb: the subject of a talk is not affectedby being talked about; indeed, on the words spoken are affected (brought into being in this case)by the speaking (cf. the home is not affected by being gone to, but something picked and movedthere obviously is). I think this is a fatuous description of when to use "e" or not.  Many direct objects are not affected by the object of the verb, e.g., "mi toki e toki pona".I think that all direct objects should get "e".  jan Setepo / stevo
