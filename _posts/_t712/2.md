>Yeah, figuring out when what one takes in English (or Esperanto or ...) as adirect object is onein tp is a real problem. And figuring out when there are automatic rightgroupingds is another.If it is true that "toki X" means (inter alia, of course) "talks about X," then,on the analogywith "tawa X" meaning "goes to", a right groups starts after "toki" on theanalogy with "tawa tomoona" "goes to his home" (and so like a preposition). Similarly, apparently,"speaks in tokipona" is "toki toki pona," not "toki pi toki pona" (of courase, while this isthe logical way tosay this, it may not be correct --
 I sure hope the "lon" version isn't right,but there is always"kepeken"). As for the official line on when to use "e," the usual story isthat "e" is not usedif the referent is not affected by the action of the verb: the subject of a talkis not affectedby being talked about; indeed, on the words spoken are affected (brought intobeing in this case)by the speaking (cf. the home is not affected by being gone to, but somethingpicked and movedthere obviously is). I'm not sure that this distinction is in fact uasedconsistently or whetherit ultimately makes any sense.
