I believe I have established the parts of speech (grammatical wordcategories) of Toki Pona.- head noun, e.g. lawa = head- modifier, e.g. lawa = main, leading- transitive verb, e.g. lawa = to lead, control- separator, e.g. li, e, la, o, pi- emphasizer, e.g. kin- interjection, e.g. mu! a!- quasi-preposition, e.g. lon, tawa, tanI will soon be able to restructure the Toki Pona word list totranslate the various word meanings according to their part of speech.Interestingly, intransitive verbs fall under "modifier". Forexample "lape" as a modifier means "relating to sleep" or "sleeping,asleep". (jan lape = sleep-person, sleeping person)Thus a basic idea like "ona li lape" (I sleep.) is really saying "Sheis asleep".Whereas "lape e" (transitive verb) would mean "to make sleep". mamali lape e jan lili. Mother put the child to sleep.Note that transitive verbs are almost always followed by "e + (directobject)". If necessary, a "filler" object like "ijo" or "jan" can beused.mi moku e waso = I eat chicken.mi moku e ijo = I eat stuff. I am eating.mi moli e jan. = I kill people. I kill.(compare: mi moli = I am dead. I die.)When there is absolutely no ambiguity of confusing a transitive verbwith a modifier, it is OK and even common to drop the "e + (object)".mi moku e ijo = I eat things. I eat.can be simplified to:mi moku = I eat.Even thought "mi moku" could technically be interpreted as "I amfood", this is a very unlikely idea, and the interpretation above (Ieat.) would be used.The concept of intransitive verbs as modifiers also implies that itis possible to have a compound with only modifiers and no head noun.The first word you encounter could be either a head noun or amodifier.ona li lawa. = It is a head. (head noun)ona li lawa. = He is the main one. (modifier)If there is a need to show that it should be interpereted as amodifier (and not a head noun), you can always add "pi".ona li pi mi = It is mine. It belongs to me.as opposed to:ona li mi = It is me.Note that "pi" can also turn a quasi-preposition into a head noun.tan = fromtan jan = from a persontan pi jan = the origin of humansA lot of these grammal rules may sound complicated, but in fact ifyou use the language, you will see that they come quite naturally andmake sense. I just thought I'd write this up for all those who liketo hack things apart and see how the language works from the inside.Or maybe I should just admit that "intransitive verbs" are a part ofspeech to simplify all these explanations... :)Sonja
