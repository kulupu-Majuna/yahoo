Didn't mean to be obscure. If "tan" means "source/cause"if, that is, "jan litan (e) ijo" means"somebody is the source/cause of something," then "mi tan ma Tosi" means "I amthe source/cause of Germany." Since you and the site say it does not mean this, it follows that"tan" does not mean"source/cause." The obvious alternative (which fits better with say "tawa") isthat "tan" means"is derived from/is an effect of," but it does not seem to have been used inthat way except forthis case. Perhaps this case was a slip, again based on an analogy with "tawa"or perhaps thebasic word list was made up somewhat carelessly (ther are other odd cases).---
