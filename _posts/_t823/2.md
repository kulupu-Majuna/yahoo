Hmmmm! I would be inclined to say not, since the basic neaning of "tan" as anoun/intransitiveverb is of what things come from, so the sentence would be read more as "Francecomes from me."On the other hand, as a preposition, "tan" does mean (several senses of )"from." A notunreasonable analogy with "tawa" (which means several related senses of "to")would then justifyKilisijan's usage. But then, "tawa" as preposition carries over the pattern of"tawa" as verbcomplement becomes object, while "tan" does not --
 for it the subject of theverb becomes theobject of the preposition (do we need to regularize this relation? Probablynot). K's usage isreasonable as a guess but probably doesn't quite say what he wants. Inaddition, since he seemsstill to be in France (I didn't see any sign of leaving in a quick scan)probably "mi jan pi maKanse" is safer.---
