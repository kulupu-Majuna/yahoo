I want to notify the community of a few changes I've recently made tomy Toki Pona lessons.Lesson 11: Another use of the word "pi" has been described. After Ioriginally wrote the lessons, Sonja and I were discussing pi, and shesaid that this use of pi is okay to use, but I forgot to add it intothe lessons. If you would like to learn this new use, visithttp://toki.dm7.net/lesson/lesson11.html and see the section titled"Another Use." To summarize this new addition, you basically just dothis: "(object owned by person A) li pi (person A)."Lesson 16: I stripped the lesson of its approval of using "luka" tomean 5. I should've done this a long time ago, but I procrastinatedbecause I really liked using "luka" as 5. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") At any rate, the changein the language is now reflected in the lessons. A short descriptionat the end of the lesson mentions that luka used to mean 5 and how itwas used so that anyone who reads old texts and sees this usage willnot be confused.Those of you who have translated my lessons or who have written yourown lessons in other languages, you may want to go ahead and add notesabout these two issues if you haven't already done so.Thanks everyone,Pije
