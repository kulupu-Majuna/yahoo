>>An early description of the language uses luka (literally "hand") tosignify "five." Kisa has deprecated this feature in the latestofficial description of Toki Pona, and its use is slowly fading. Formore examples of this archaic structure, see \[1\], which uses luka lukaluka wan to mean "sixteen."<<....Is its use really fading? Is it really archaic? In message threadson this listgroup since January, I found 10 uses of "luka"meaning "5" and only 1 uses in the sense of "hand", besidesthree meta-discussions about the use of numbers (countingthis one). The proportion would be even more drasticallyin favor of "5" if I counted messages rather than threads, I think.The previous version of the article had this sentence,
>>However, some Toki Pona speakers still use this structure,and Pije describes it in his unofficial lessons for the language.<<which obviously needed to be revised, but I don't think therevised version is entirely accurate.Wikipedia should take a descriptive rather than aprescriptive stance, and say primarily the languageis actually used. Sonja can say how she thinksit ought to be used and some Toki Ponaspeakers will pay attention, some may not.--
