>> Lesson 11: Another use of the word "pi"There is still an unclear point about "pi" : e.g.,"the car of the strong man" = "tomo tawa pi jan wawa".That's OK. But : "the car of the weak man" would thenbe, if I replace "jan wawa" by "jan pi wawa ala" :- "tomo tawa pi jan pi wawa ala"Is this correct, although there is no adjective with"jan" but a nominal group introduced by "pi" ?jan Kanso\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
