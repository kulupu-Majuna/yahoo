Since I have never figured how to translate excel into something that looks good on the web, my two dictionaries (and sketches from others for French, German and Esperanto) are still just in my box and those of them what I have sent them to. If you can do the conversion, you are welcome to the material, which is admittedly in a rather out of date state.
