toki!  
  
I've built a preliminary English to TokiPona database from the  
dictionary posted on the main site.  
Feel free to download it and expand it as needed.  
  
Hmm. I just realized I misnamed the file. Oh well!  
  
You can find it at: http://www.tassano.org/TokiPona2Eng.tab  
  
It's plain text, tab-separated fields. Should import into your favorite  
database manager. This version uses Macintosh line endings (linefeed)  
but I can make one with Windows endings (CR/linefeed) if this poses  
difficulties.  
  
Sorry for the English post...
