Ifso, do we really need "X ala X," as in "sina sona ala sona e tokipona?" Couldn't we just say, "sina sona e toki pona?" when we want ayes/no question? <<< jan Sonja is to decide. I think that, in order to distinguish an "anu" question from an "anu" sentence, we might start the former with, e.g.: "mi wile sona e ni:" to makeclear that it's a question; otherwise it's a normal sentence of statement. jan Elumutu
