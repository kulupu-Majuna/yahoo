The "affected" rule (the source of which I cannot find at the moment)isprobably too stringent (if it makes any sense at all).  jan Pije's Lesson 6:tawaUsing tawa as a verbHopefully you understood lon well, because tawa is similar to it. Like lon, tawa doesn't have an e after it.   mi tawa tomo mi. --
 I'm going to my house.   ona mute li tawa utala - They're going to the war.   sina wile tawa telo suli. --
 You want to go to the ocean.   ona li tawa sewi kiwen. --
 She's going up the rock.      Note that sewi as used in this sentence is a noun. A more literal        translation of that sentence is "She's going to the top (of) the rock."The reason that lon and tawa don't have an e after them is that there is no object. For example, in the sentence "I'm going to my house," the speaker simply went home. He did not do anything to his house, he just went to it. If he had burned the house down or had tried to do something to it or affect it in some way, then e would come after the verb. Otherwise, no e. I have to agree that there seems to be no direct object in these examples, so there should not be "e". jan Setepo / stevo
