The wiki article is athttp://[http://www.bluwiki.com/wiki/Toki_PonaAll](http://www.bluwiki.com/wiki/Toki_PonaAll) of the information from the Wikipedia article has been copiedstraight over. Attached to the bottom of the article is a list of allcontributors to the Wikipedia article; this list must be included toobey the terms of the GFDL license.The article needs just a little cleaning up because not everythingcopied perfectly from Wikipedia. The pictures also need to be added.If anyone wants to work on it, feel free. As time permits, I may workon cleaning it up, too.
