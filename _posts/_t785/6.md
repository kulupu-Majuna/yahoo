Talking about the modified rule: "use "li" always when using parallelpredicates" So, I say "mi"and then i have to decide whether I am going to use a parallel predicate, whichmay take mefarther ahead than I have gotten in my thoughts. But, if I leave out the "li"and go directly tothe predicate, I can't then shift over to the parallel form. As you say, if wealways use "li"there is no problem. and, of course, I never have to use a parallel predicate.---
