 which youoften don't know.I'm sure to understand what you mean, because of my English. Are youtalking about the problems for the listener to understand a sentencelike "mi Modifier1 Modifier2 li Verb"? But if the rule were \*always\*to use "li" after all subjects, there would be no problem. May youexplain with a example?Jan Mako--
