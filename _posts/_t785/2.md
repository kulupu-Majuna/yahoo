But there's no easy way to getrid of the exception because all existing texts would mean differentthings since then. It would be easier to change the rule in yourdirection: get rid of all "li" with pronouns. In that case, existingtexts would look just "arcaic" Fortunately, there are not many best-sellers sold yet ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\
