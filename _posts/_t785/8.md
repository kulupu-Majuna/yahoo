Is paralell predicate souseful to make "li" mandatory for all pronouns? I don't think so.Really, it's easier to use separate sentence.Again, it would be easier to get rid of "li" with all pronouns. Butthen the "mute" ambiguity would affect all pronouns. And there areother combinations that could be understood both as modifiers or asintransitive verbs, for example with "tu":ona mute...mi mute...ona tu...mi tu...
