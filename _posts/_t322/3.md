At least one of them usesthe spelling "hangeul", while at least one other uses "hangÅ­l" instead(the next-to-last letter is a u-breve); given the tendence ofEnglish-speakers to drop diacritics from letters, it's not such a bigstep from "hangÅ­l" to "hangul" - which, while not the propertranscription in the system that spells it "hangÅ­l", may well be anacceptable anglicisation.Compare, for example, "romaji" as an English name for Japaneseromanisations, which is probably derived from the Hepburntranscription "rÅmaji"; again, the diacritic (a macron over the o, inthis case) got lost in "converting" to an English word.In other words, IMO it makes a difference whether you're transcribinga text from language X/writing system Y, or whether you're using aborrowed word which \*originated\* from such a transcription.(Incidentally, do you spell encyclopÃ¦dia and manÅ“uvre like that? Afterall, they're arguably "the proper romanization" of those words.)Hm. mi wile ala utala e sina - I don't want to attack you; if thiscame across a bit too acerbic, I apologise.Cheers,--
