Interface?I'd be actively against an OOo user interface in Toki Pona since Ibelieve that the required precision of a program's user interface goescontrary to the "small and simple" philosophy of the language.Besides, I'd imagine you'd either have to (a) be extremely verbose(which might make things difficult with screen real estate), (b) beextremely vague, or (c) use lots of non-standard words (such as "ijoFajelo" for "File", or whatever).
