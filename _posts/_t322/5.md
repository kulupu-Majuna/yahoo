I meant the official romanization of thegovernment, as much as the kunrei-siki of the Japanese government isofficial. The most accurate romanization for Korean is that of thegovernment, though aspirated consonants are not marked (which Ifurther modify by adding an apostrophe after the consonant!). ^\_^I like accuracy, as there is a difference in the vowels, 'eu' and 'u'in korean, and simplifying 'eu' into 'u' will get somemiscomphrehension in speaking korean. I know that I'm picky, and thefact that not all are korean as well, but I'm just picky! :p
