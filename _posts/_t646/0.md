jan ali, toki!Mi jan Helmut tan ma Tosi, mi lon ma tomo Pelin.As I have started to deal with toki pona only a few days ago, I haveto continue in English for the time being.I want to ask some toki pona related questions and to make a proposalto solve the problem of using large numbers: Why not add thefollowing four words to the official wordlist: ten (10), sen (100 - "cent"), tasan (1000 - "thousand") and mijo ("million"). So it wouldbe extremely easy to express any number such as tu ten luka = 25 ortenpo seki pi nanpa tu tasan luka tu (2007).Now, here are my questions:1. How can I say "right" and "left", "sufficient", "between", "infront of" in toki pona?2. How can I express sentences like "Do you feel better?" or "I'm thegrea test!", i.e. comparisons with the compared side missing?3. When saying 'tenpo suno pini la mi pilin ike.', then how can Idistinguish between "I felt sick yesterday" and "I've been feelingsick since yesterday".4. How can I tokiponize my first name "Helmut" best?Mi pilin pona tan ni: mi awen e toki kama sina.Pona!akesi\_palisa
