The guideline about the number of syllables is actually expressed rather weakly, making it clear that it shouldn't be considered an absolute rule. In the case of "Russ" I actually like the tokiponisation "Wasa" more than "Wa", because "Russ" already contains little phonetic information, so you want to avoid losing any more. But in the end it's of course Russ' decision how he wants to tokiponise his name. (One can also pick a Toki Pona name completely unrelated to one's real name, as some people have done, eg. jan Wasolitawa; my Toki Pona name (jan Moku) is also not entirely based on my real name (Marcos), but also on my love for food).jan Moku.
