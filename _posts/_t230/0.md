Ithink we need a lexicon for religion for toki pona for thosereligious like me! like, for some sort of great happiness place,nirvana, heaven, valhalla, etc... can it be like ma pi pona mute orma pona? and if there is a hell, place of suffering, it could be likema pi ike mute or ma ike, something like that....Holy book, religious book - lipu toki sewiTorah - lipu toki sewi TolaQuran - lipu toki sewi KulanBible - lipu toki sewi Pipija (?)to pray (Christian) - li toki tawa jan sewito meditate (Buddhist) - li pilin alato speak in tongues (Christian/Santeria) - li toki kepekentoki/kalama sewi (?)prayer - toki (pona) sewi (?)to cast a spell (to something) (Wicca) - li pana e wile (tawa ijo)to cast a circle (Wicca) - li pali e siketo fast - li moku ala (tawa pona)Don't forget like, names of other religions!Wicca - nasin WikaSatanism - nasin SatanSanteria - nasin SantelijaBaha'ism - nasin Pajawi (?)just a thought and examples! nasin mute li pona tawa jan pi ma ale!
