1) Keep the meaning of the poem as much as possible2) Keep the number of sylabes in every verse3) Keep the rhyme as in original4) Live with constraints of grammar of destination language.5) Make rhyme  without repeating last words.out of these five 'requirements', only #1 and #4 are actually required.  if the other three are not met, then the resulting translation may not match the original in some way, but if the sense of the poem is conveyed, how much does the form matter?  of course, if all five CAN be met, then all the better.  and i imagine that doing that in tokipona is truly a challenge.stevo
