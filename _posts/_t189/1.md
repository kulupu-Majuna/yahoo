> out of these five 'requirements', only #1 and #4 are actually required.e.g. the English translation of the poem doesn't preserve the rhyme or thenumber of syllables. (it also sucks for other reasons)Rhyme is very language-dependant. Translating poems into Japanese andpreserving rhyme, for example, is just silly. So, I believe, is translatingthem into TP.It's a good translation anyway.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!
