Since the Google interface can already be set to work in almost all of the languages you can imagine, including Klingon, l33t and Elmer Fudd, I thought they could add Toki Pona to the list so I emailed them.Here is their answer:Thank you for your interest in the Google in Your Language program. Atthis time, we're unable to support more languages. However, we appreciateyour suggestion, and we'll consider adding Toki Pona to this program inthe future.Regards,The Google Team
