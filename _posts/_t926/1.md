Why not use tokipona.net?[http://tokipona.net/tokipona/It](http://tokipona.net/tokipona/It) is a custom search engine, which restricts your results to tokipona related pages.After searching, if you didn't find what you wanted in thetokiponasphere, there is a radio button to search the entire web.Personally, I think google chose L33t and Fudd as jokes. Toki ponaobviously is a serious language, not deserving of being the butt of ageeky user interface joke.Matthew MartinOn Dec 15, 2007 10:48 AM, Dan <[redalastor@gmail.com](mailto://redalastor@gmail.com)\
