What you call them may change, depending on what you're trying to sayabout them or what you're trying to distinguish them from.Try to think, "What's the most important aspect of the dolphin in thissentence?" Then use that word as the root of the substantive. Thenthink, "How precisely do I really \*need\* to describe it?" Use only asmany words as you \*must\* (then think about using one less than that).If you're saying that the dolphin was leaping and flipping from thesea (in a very "fishy" manner), then you can just call it "kala". Ifyou want to describe how you felt that ancestral connection, call it"soweli kala". If it's hunting fish, you might call it "kala soweli"to distinguish it from the fish being hunted.
