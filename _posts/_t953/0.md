I've been looking through the lessons again, and I'm a bit confused onthe animals."kala" is "fish and other animals that live in water." So are crabsand dolphins "kala?" That seems to be what the pictures suggest. Ithought they were "pipi telo" and "soweli telo" (or "soweli kala")respectively. Or does it work either way?ni li lon ala lon: "soweli" li jo e linja li pana e telo mama. "kala"li jo e selo sama akesi. "pipi" li jo e selo kiwen.jan Sosuwa
