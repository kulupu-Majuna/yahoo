I've noticed that "anu" is used in questions, just like "or" in English:  
  
sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu tawa tomo moku? Would you like to  
see a movie or go to a restaurant?  
  
However, without the question mark, this becomes:  
sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu tawa tomo moku. You want to see a  
movie or go to a restaurant.  
  
In other words, it is only the inflection (or the question mark in  
written Toki Pona) that makes it a question instead of a statement.  
  
However, this would be difficult for a speaker of a tonal language,  
which (I'm guessing) is why yes-no questions are used with the "X ala  
X'" construction:  
  
sina sona ala sona e toki pona? Do you speak Toki Pona?  
  
This seems inconsistent to me.
