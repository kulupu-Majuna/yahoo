I like yours.  
  
I've got one: "sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu ni: sina tawa tomo  
moku" or something like that involving the "ni:" construction.

used in analogy with "ken" as follows: "ken la ..." is possible in tp.  
So we might as well say: sina wile ala wile lukin e sitelen tawa. anu  
la (,) sina wile ala wile tawa tomo moku. Yes, it's somewhat longer  
but not too complex or vague at all.

already about whether it should be extreme simplicity (accepting that  
even simple things like "crossroads, direction, between, etc." are too  
complex for tp) or the capability of expressing (nearly) everything in  
tp. I'm clearly fond of the second option. Besides, I'd like to  
suggest to classify tp words only as follows: structural particles (e,  
la, li, pi, taso, kin), pronouns (mi, sina, ona, ni), basic words  
(which can be used as subject, predicate, object, property,  
conjunction, modifier, specifier, etc. as necessary), and capitalized  
unofficial words. In that case, one could say, e. g., "anu tu taso li  
lon" meaning "there are only two alternatives" (stressing "tu").
