Just another suggestion for expressing "or" questions: Might "anu" used in analogy with "ken" as follows: "ken la ..." is possible in tp. So we might as well say: sina wile ala wile lukin e sitelen tawa. anu la (,) sina wile ala wile tawa tomo moku. Yes, it's somewhat longer but not too complex or vague at all.  
As for the main idea of tp, we had discussions in the group already about whether it should be extreme simplicity (accepting that even simple things like "crossroads, direction, between, etc." are too complex for tp) or the capability of expressing (nearly) everything in tp. I'm clearly fond of the second option. Besides, I'd like to suggest to classify tp words only as follows: structural particles (e, la, li, pi, taso, kin), pronouns (mi, sina, ona, ni), basic words (which can be used as subject, predicate, object, property, conjunction, modifier, specifier, etc. as necessary), and capitalized unofficial words. In that case, one could say, e. g., "anu tu taso li lon" meaning "there are only two alternatives" (stressing "tu").
