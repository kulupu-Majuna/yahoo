As I understand it, "anu" is never used in statements, only in questions.  
(See http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson12.html)  
  
Your example (wanting to see a movie or go to a restaurant) is too  
complex and too vague. Even if you simplify, it won't fit into a  
single Toki Pona sentence.  
  
Even your initial question had serious problems.  
"sina wile lukin e sitelen tawa anu tawa tomo moku?" means  
"Do you want to see either a movie or(otherwise) (see) a foodish house-go.  
The skeleton sentence is "You want".  
"anu" separates predicate substantives. It does not allow you to have  
a second verb.
