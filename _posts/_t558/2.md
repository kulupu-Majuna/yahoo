Also, the "e" is reserved for "tawa"s "other" meaning "move" "A li tawa B e C"means "C is insituation X, A does something Y to C, As a result, C is in situation B." If C isnot mentioned itis A or a part of A. If Y is mentioned, it becomes the main verb and "tawa B"goes to the end.If X is mentioned it goes to the end after "tan."---
