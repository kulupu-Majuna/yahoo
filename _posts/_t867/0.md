There has been some mention on this list of the rule that says "A li B e C,"when "B" is a wordnot normally thought of as a transitive verb, is to be understood as "A makes CB/ brings it aboutthat C li B/ causes C to (be) B.There are some parallel regularities: If A is a transitive verb, A as a noun isthe generic termfor the direct object of A "moku," for example is the transitive verb "eat" (youcan't eat withoutsomething being eaten. What is eaten is ipso facto food, "moku" as a noun. Related to this isthat the nouns from "tawa" class verbs are the generic complement: "ona tan tan""it is from thesource" is a convenient tautology.None of these patterns is carried through completely in the word list:causatives are not usuallylisted separately, unless there is a specialization that meaning that is ofinterest (though"tomo" "to build, construct" hasn't been listed). Many of the nouns from verbs(as we might say)are also not listed nor used: "tawa" is not down as "goal, destination,direction," for example,but only variations of the verbal noun "going."In one sense, the second principle might be seen as a special case of the first:eating somethingis causing it to be food in a very immediate sense. This immediate sense ischaracteristic of thedirect object nouns when there is a merely classifying noun to contrast it with:"kepeken" for"tool" is something actually used to do something, whether or not it wasdesigned/intended forthat purpose; "ilo" was so designed but might never be so used (I have ascrewdriver --
 designedto drive screw --
 which I use only to open paint cans - as ilo it drives screws,as kepeken itopens cans.)conversely, the nouns could all be taken as patients for theactivities of the verbs:food is what is being/has been/is to be eaten.Perhaps this can be worked up into one or several systems; for now, I just notethe relations.Are there others that you have noticed?
