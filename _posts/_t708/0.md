I think there's no justification to make exceptions: ifthere's one rule, there's one rule; ambiguity could be caused indeedif the accent could go on different syllabes, depending on the wordkind or lenght.I have the impression that the accent on the last but one syllabe,like Esperanto, would cause no more ambiguity than the accent on thefirst one, and at the same time it would be easier and nicer in longwords (specially in proper names).
