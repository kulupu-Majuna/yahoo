Yes, I think that accent rules for proper adjectives --
 which are not strictlytp words --
 areseparate from the rule, especially when they run to three or more syllable. This still introducesthe possibility of ambiguity, but not so strongly, since most names will mimictp word stringsonly minimally (generally). (cf. the situation in Lojban --
 which suggests wemight want a writingconvention to show non-initial accents.)---
