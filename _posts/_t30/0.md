The results of the 'iki' poll are in.The voice of the majority has chosen 'ona' as the new word forhe/she/it/they. This word comes from Croatian ona (she). Thank youfor your participation.The word 'iki' will still exist... as an archaism.I have devised the slogan "ona li pona!" to promote our new word.Enjoy...Sonja/MarraskuuCreator of Toki Pona
