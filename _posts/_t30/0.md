The results of the 'iki' poll are in.

The voice of the majority has chosen 'ona' as the new word for
he/she/it/they. This word comes from Croatian ona (she). Thank you
for your participation.

The word 'iki' will still exist... as an archaism.

I have devised the slogan "ona li pona!" to promote our new word.

Enjoy...
