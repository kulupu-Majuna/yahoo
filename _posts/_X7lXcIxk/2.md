Toki,  
  
For a constucted language, it's more important to have a broad  
collection of translations and long texts than endless speeches on  
such or such grammatical characteristic. It's a question of vitality  
and credibility towards outside.  
  
I don't know if Toki pona has more speakers than Kotava, but in any  
case, the Kotava speakers translate much, and not only short texts.  
Some online available examples:  
\- Tao Te Ching (Lao Zi):  
http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Tao\_Te\_Tcing\_luz\_01 (with  
sound extracts)  
\- Scapin's Deceits (Les fourberies de Scapin, Molière):  
http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/NhagaceemScapin\_Nakileem01\_Nakila01  
  
\- The Little Prince (Saint Exupéry):  
http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Sersikam\_Luz01  
\- Ecclesiast book (Bible):  
http://www.europalingua.eu/wikikrenteem/Biblia\_Koxelet\_Blokey01  
  
And in the field of the tales and legends:  
\- 100 legends of the World :  
http://www.scribd.com/doc/2891628/100-legends-of-the-World-in-Kotava  
\- Bambara tales (Africa) :  
http://www.scribd.com/doc/2676190/Bambara-tales-translated-in-Kotava  
  
And many other.  
  
Cordially
