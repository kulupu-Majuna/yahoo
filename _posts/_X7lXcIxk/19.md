But if you do not translate texts or do not write significant original  
texts, how make you to really progress in the individual control of  
the language and to become fluent? Because, for Toki pona, Kotava or  
other (except Esperanto maybe), with so few speakers, scattered around  
all the world, I suppose that the occasions to talk are very rare and  
the direct chat is very limited.

I agree. But it is a good indicator of vitality and personal fluency  
of the members of the community.
