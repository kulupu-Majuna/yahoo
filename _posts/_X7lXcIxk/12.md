I think Toki Pona lends itself well to compact proverbs. I'd like to  
see a wiki to collect original or translated "nuggets of wisdom" to  
expand upon Sonja's "toki sona" page. I have a few to add.  
Interpretation is left to the reader. :-)  
  
"kama la, ni kin li tawa weka."  
  
"nimi pona wan li ken toki mute."  
  
"jan pi sona ala li jo ala. o kama sona."
