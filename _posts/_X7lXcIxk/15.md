I'll try a translation again, something very short.  
  
asato ma sat gamaya  
From illusion lead me to Truth.  
sina lawa e mi tawa lon.  
sina weka e lon ala tan mi.  
  
Tamaso ma jyotir gamaya  
From darkness lead me to light.  
sina lawa e mi tawa sina suno.  
sina weka e suno ala tan mi.  
  
Mrityor ma amritam gamaya  
From death lead me to immortality.  
sina lawa e mi tawa moli ala.  
sina weka e moli tan mi.  
  
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad -- I.iii.28
