I have to agree.  
  
If you want cultural neutrality and a logical, consistent grammar,  
you might want to look into Lojban. Now there's a language that has  
lots of translated texts!  
  
I'm also part of the Láadan community, and while I'm still learning  
the language, I'm trying to get some more texts translated.  
(Currently, there are only a few, done by the same few people.) I've  
translated a few texts, with some help from one of the fluent  
speakers. I'd love to get Láadan--and Toki Pona--to the level of  
Lojban in terms of the amount of translated texts.  
  
Translated texts are necessary (but not sufficient in and of  
themselves) for any conlang community.
