In a notebook somewhere I have a translation of the parable of the  
Good Samaritan, and the Canticle of Zechariah, which I haven't yet  
posted. Maybe we could work together on the Gospel of Luke,  
starting with the parables, then the connected narratives and finally  
the interstitial bits. Somebody's already done the Magnificat, haven't  
they?
