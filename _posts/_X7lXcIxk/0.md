As you probably guessed from that fact that I like Toki Pona, I really  
enjoy conlangs. So I like to look at what other conlang groups are doing.  
  
There's a huge page of texts translated into Lojban here:  
  
http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Texts+In+Lojban&bl  
  
Now, I realize that Lojban and Toki Pona have somewhat opposite  
philosophies (hence jan Pije's "jan Lojban" jokes). But the Lojban  
community has done community translations of things as big as the  
Bible and Alice in Wonderland. I'm also learning Laadan, and one of  
the more experienced speakers and I are working on a collaborative  
translation of Super Mario World together.  
  
It seems that not much is going on in this group, so I was wondering  
if anyone would be interested in having at least some of us work on a  
translation of a large project. (I'm really impressed that jan Pije  
translated an entire movie script!) I'd be open to suggestions as to  
what we could translate...
