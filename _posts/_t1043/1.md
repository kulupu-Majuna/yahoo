I think "jo" is used more in the sense of "to have" as a verbs, and "pi" worksmore like a possessive. "Ilo ni li pi sina" means more like "this is your tool"and "sina jo ilo ni" is "you own this tool," like you said. I think it's more ofa question of style, they both mean essentially the same thing, it's just aslightly different way to phrase it.I might be wrong though, I don't understand Toki Pona very well yet.-TylerTo: [tokipona@yahoogroups.comFrom](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.comFrom): [xavieram@yahoo.comDate](mailto://xavieram@yahoo.comDate): Fri, 15 May 2009 07:53:55 +0000Subject: \[tokipona\] pi vs joForgive my newb question, but I'm trying to work some stuff out to understandthis better...Reading lesson 11 ([http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson11.html](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson11.html)) Isee that you can use "pi" to indicate ownership of something.ilo ni li pi sina. --
 This tool is yours.But... doesn't jo cover this already?sina jo ilo ni --
 You own this tool.Is it a case of having multiple ways of saying the same thing? Will one workbetter in some cases than others? Or am I just not understanding this very well?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Hotmail® has ever-growing storage!
