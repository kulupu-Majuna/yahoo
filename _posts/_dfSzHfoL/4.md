Thanks all! I'll try to learn the language before our symposium tomorrow. (Otherwise I'll just make stuff up.)  
  
Here in Taiwan, most people are what you would call Daoists. I'll be sure to mention the connection.  
  
What--conceptual thought is bad? Oh well, I mostly work on autopilot anyway.

> Tokiponology -> sona pi toki pona  
> However this is a concept, and Toki Pona doesn't like them very much. Most of the time you'll just be saying "toki pona" if you mean the language, or "sona pona" if you mean the (Taoist) underlying philosophy.  
> Tokiponologist -> jan pi toki pona (Toki Pona speaker), or jan sona pi toki pona (Toki Pona teacher/specialist)  
> But then again, you'll use "jan pi toki pona" most often, unless you want to emphasize great knowledge of the language.
