Several of the people on this list use the word "concept"  
in ways that seem odd to me -- not sure if they're  
not native speakers of English, or speakers of  
dialects other than mine. I would tend to use  
the word "abstraction" in most of the contexts  
where e.g. jan\_sewe was using "concept" in  
recent posts. To me "conceptual thought"  
is a pleonasm, like "archaic old things" or  
"mnemonic memory" or "pulmonary lungs".  
"conceptual" is the adjective form of "concept"  
which is a fancy word for "a thought", not necessarily  
an abstract thought, which is the kind of thought  
that I think jan\_sewe and some other toki pona  
speakers think that toki pona discourages -- not  
sure if I agree with them there, either. It seems  
to me that e.g. "soweli" is more of an an abstraction  
than concrete terms in other languages like "dog",  
"kinkajou", "marmoset" etc.; "pipi" more abstract  
than "bee", "junebug", "firefly", etc. (On the other  
hand "soweli" and "pipi" are less exact and technical  
terms than their closest equivalents in English,  
"mammal" and "insect" -- the latter have connections  
to scientific ideas about evolution and taxonomy  
that aren't connoted by the toki pona terms.)
