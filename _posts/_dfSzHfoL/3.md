I like "nasin sona pi toki pona" (although it seems to suggest that tp's a way to know things...). But in general, words in -gy begin with sona:  
  
Tokiponology -> sona pi toki pona  
  
However this is a concept, and Toki Pona doesn't like them very much. Most of the time you'll just be saying "toki pona" if you mean the language, or "sona pona" if you mean the (Taoist) underlying philosophy.  
  
Tokiponologist -> jan pi toki pona (Toki Pona speaker), or jan sona pi toki pona (Toki Pona teacher/specialist)  
  
But then again, you'll use "jan pi toki pona" most often, unless you want to emphasize great knowledge of the language.
