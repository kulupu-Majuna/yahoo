Hi everybody! Missionary work's going great!  
  
How do you say "Tokiponology" in Toki Pona? You know, like people who study the Esperanto movement are Esperantologists (as opposed to ordinary Interlinguists), which would either be "Esperantologistoj" or "Esperantologoj." So what do you call somebody whose academic speciality is studying the Toki Pona movement?  
  
(Putting together a file on you guys in case Toki Pona gets adopted by the Antichrist for his one-world government.)
