toki!After learning toki pona for a week, I've got an idea - toki pona isperfectly suited for hieroglyphic writing. Learn less than 120 symbolsis easy enough. All TP words will get a "visual appearance" this way.BTW I've made some RoadLingua TP-English dictionaries (RoadLingua is adictionary software for PalmOS and PocketPC). If someone is interestedI will send this little thing to him/her...
