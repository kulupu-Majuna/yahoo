All TP words will get a "visual appearance" this way.A syllabary would work as well or better.9 cononants X 5 vowels = 45 basic syllable signsPlus a diacritic or separate character to indicatesyllable-final -n.That way, you could write tokiponized proper nameswith the same writing system as the root words(unlike the proposal to use Chinese ideograms withroughly the same meanings as the toki pona root words).We could adapt it from the katakana or hiragana,or start from scratch. Can't use hiraganaas-is because it lacks signs for "wi" or "je"among others. But we could map the hiraganar-series to toki pona syllables starting with "l",and the h-series to syllables starting with "p", leavingonly "wi", "we", "je". Japanese has "wo" and Toki Ponadoes not, so we could use the "wo" kana for our "we"and need only two new characters to invent or borrowfrom somewhere else.- Jim HenryBook review weblog: [http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/review/log.htm](http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/review/log.htm)
