>> Of course "foreign" words still have to be dealt with.It's still an alphabet, since every shape is a letter, put togetherinto syllabic unti blocks. It is even called by many, theKorean/Hangeul alphabet. (One of the best writing system sitesonline, [http://www.omniglot.com](http://www.omniglot.com) calls the Korean Hangeul script,alphabetic!) And why make a new 'e,' when there is an 'e' letter? Ijust use the 'eo' letter because it's easier to draw, asthe 'jamo' 'e' utilises two strokes, while 'jamo eo' uses one! ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
