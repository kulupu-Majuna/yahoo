Well, as I use toki pona in my life and in my daily log book,sometimes I use hiragana and Hangeul to represent TP. But as I findout later, I find that the best East Asian writing that could fit TPwould be the alphabetic Korean Hangeul, changing the 'eo' characterinto the 'e' in TP as modification. It's perfect, but the onlysacrifice in it is that it will have that plain and simple look; aphilosophy of Toki Pona, but can be quite dull to look at. But undercalligraphy, Korean writing can be very poignant.---
