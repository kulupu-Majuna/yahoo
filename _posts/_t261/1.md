This isn't exactly completely related to the above message, but Ijust had an idea...What about using Chinese symbols for Toki-Ponese words? It would beeasy to find 118 Chinese logographs that corresponded exactly (oralmost exactly) to the base roots of TP. Because so many words arevery similar, I often confuse them (alas! I reap my punishment forreading all the lessons in less than two days!). However, withcharacters, it would be easy to mentally distinguish them if eachone were sure to have a fairly unique shape or design.Well, that's my idea, take it or leave it. I've been using TP as apersonal language anyway, so I'll proabably design some sort ofsystem using the above idea to make it even more unfamiliar toprying eyes. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\-jan Kowi
