Thetime you spend going somewhere and the speed you do it at are onlyindirectly related. You're describing the effect of having gone fast.It's like describing that there was a hole in the wall after a largeman passed as a way of saying he was angry.Give me a Ferrari and the autobahn and I can assure you that I will betraveling very fast, but also that it will take me a very long time togo wherever I'm supposed to be going because I will spend far moretime than I should just driving random places at high speeds.---
