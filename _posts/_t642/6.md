I do see the problem, but, as I said, the notion here seems to rely on thecontrast between howmuch gets done and the time it takes: you may take what is --
 against some otherstandard --
 along time but you get a whole lot more done in that time than the standard mightexpect --
 so atleast you did things faster than the standard (which is what "fast" meansultimately). I am notinsisting on this, since it opens no paths to the notion of speed itself (norvelocity, noracceleration, nor inertia and so on); what I offer is just the way that othershave solved the oneproblem. Now to consider the next one, hopefully getting in the process a betterway to deal withthe first.---
