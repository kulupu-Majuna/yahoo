Hi Richardtp-fr.php.htm is readylearn.php.tm in french is readysounds.php.htm in french is readytp1.php.htm, tp2.php.htm, tp3.php.htm, tp4.php.htm are ready.I did send yesterday 3 pages (tp1.php.htm, tp1.php.htm in french andtp1.php.htm in german) answering your mail and did see after that,that all people get html pages after that :In my opinion it is not the best way to transmit html pages to you.Can you give me a direct email address?Problem with your gramatical classification in tp-en.php.htm :I don't find the classification usefull. It is the same as the newtrend to introduce a classification on chinese. It's not right in myopinion...For this reason I didn't take care of the classification in tp-fr.php.htm !If you will really have a classification, tp-fr.php.htm must to bechecked and corriged. Specially is transitiv and not transitivnonsens in other languages or you have to check really carefull thegramatical usage of each term...Because it would be to much work for me for today I did onlytranslate and not erase the given classification.Forum :I would find a forum better as an user-group!Please look at : [http://espaceforums.naucelle.com/](http://espaceforums.naucelle.com/)(You will see under "Europe for european people" that I did spokeabout toki pona and announce the rebuilding of you site. But it isnot my purpose today : )You will see a forum machine from [http://forum.europeanservers.net/](http://forum.europeanservers.net/) .It is really easy to introduce a picture in each contribution on thismachine.Picture are a really usefull way to communicate without to have toexplain a lot of matter... (Try yourself to place an answer withpicture in the forum [http://espaceforums.naucelle.com/](http://espaceforums.naucelle.com/) perhaps in thecontribution where I did announce your new site!)I wish you a good week end!Fran√ßois
