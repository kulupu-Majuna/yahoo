Well, back to logic v. usage. I have manged to use "pini" in this way and, Ithink, "open'" Thatis logic. But we know how unreliable that is with tp. Still, these seem to bethinks we want tosay often enough to record them as legitmate. If we think of them astense/aspect markers, wemight want to add "pali" as well.---
