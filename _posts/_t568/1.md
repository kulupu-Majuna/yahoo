toki.my opinion on these:
> How do you say "old" in Toki Pona?
>> E.g., My old friend is very young.
> My new friend is very old.generally the term for a year/age is "tenpo pi sike e suno". to "go around thesun".so for old/young i'd say: jan pi sike mute/lili e suno.for fresh/new you can use "sin" or "pi tenpo lili".jan pona mi pi tenpo mute li sike lili e suno.jan pona sin mi li sike mute mute e suno.
>before/after (in times);this is some kind of comparative, which do not exist in tp.you can either try to use, tenpo pini, tenpo ante etc or just use 2 sentences.if something is at the same moment i try to use multiple lis or la/tan.mi kama tawa tomo toki. mi toki tawa jan Pije. "i went to the chatroom. (then) ispoke with Pije."
>alive/live (v);mi lon. i exist (live).
> far/near;nearby: pokafar: bit harder. what do you want to say exactly?
> kind of;most likely sama or just drop it. what sentence exactly? the same (as in "These two things are the same; there is
> no difference" or "I saw the same thing";sama. ijo ni li sama. mi lukin e sama.
> other.ante.mi tawa,jan Posi (Fossi)--
