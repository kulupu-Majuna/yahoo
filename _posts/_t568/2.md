o toki !I'm not expert, but I'm trying to give you some explanations :SIN = New/nouveau/nuevo # SIN ALA = Ancient, old/ancien/antiguoSULI or LILI ALA= Old (age)/vieux/viejo # LILI = Young/jeune/jovenSo, the sentence "My old friend is very young" could be translated by " Janpona mi pi sin ala li lili mute"And "My new friend is very old" by "Jan pona sin mi li suli mute"Before = PINI # After = KAMAI'm alive, I exist = MI LONNear = POKA # Far = POKA ALAKind of = NASINSame = SAMA"These two things are the same " = " Ijo tu ni li sama""I saw the same thing" = " Tenpo pini la, mi lukin e ijo sama"I hope i didn't make too much mistakes. In that case, the real and greatTokiponists (Jan Kanso, Jan Pije, Jim Henry, Jan Pita and many others...)could rectify and adjust it.Just an advice : do look at all the lessons and vocabulary, and try to writea little in TPo awen ponaJan Janluka

>>How do you say "old" in Toki Pona?
>>E.g., My old friend is very young.
>My new friend is very old.
>>Other words I don't know how to say: before/after (in times); alive/live
>(v);
> far/near; kind of; the same (as in "These two things are the same; there

>no difference" or "I saw the same thing"; other.
