I'll talk a little about each phrase you suggested.sama la : likewise : simileAlthough this does seem a bit odd to me, I think it'sbecause I haven't seen it used much. It seems to makegood sense.lon la: really, currently : vere, nuneI'd just use kin.ante la: otherwise, on the contrary, on the other hand: kontrauxeLooks good to me.mi la: as far as I'm concerned : laux miEww, no. I'd say something like this instead:mi pilin e ni: ...lawa la: mainly : principeI can't see anything wrong with this per se, but itjust seems odd to me. I think that in Toki Pona youmight just want to drop little words like "mainly"anyway.pona la: fortunately : bonsxanceike la: unfortunately : bedauxrindeWhy not just use them as adverbs? I don't understandwhat difference there would be. These are moresimplistic in the main sentence.poka la: besides : krome, plueI don't see a real connection between the English word"besides" and the side of the something. So using pokalike this doesn't make sense to me. I might use "taso"('but') instead.tan ni la: consequently : sekveYes, you can do this. People used to do it this way.It just kinda dropped out of style. Personally, Ithink the phrase makes more sense with "tan ni" in themain sentence, but you could use it as a la phrase ifyou really wanted to I guess.jan Pije\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Vote for the stars of Yahoo!'s next ad campaign![http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/](http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/)
