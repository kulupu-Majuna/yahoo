To give it a start, here what I imagine to be imortant to TokiPoan or world culture in the different months (trying not to be toocountry/culture-dependent):January - New year \[sin\]February - chinese new year (though this can sometimes be at the end of january)\[Sonko\]March - Foundation of this yahoogroup \[sitelen\]April - April Fool's Day \[musi\]May - Labour Day \[pali\]June - longest day \[suno\]July - Toki Pona was published in July 2001, wasn't it? \[toki pona\]August - travel (e.g. to Esperanto-meetings) \[tawa\]September - Respect for the Aged Day in Japan \[lili ala\]October - ?November - Sonja's birthday \[Sonja\] or \[jan Sonja\]December - longest night \[pimeja\]Of course, one always adds "tenpo mun" in front of what is in the abovebrackets.What do people think?Marcos.
