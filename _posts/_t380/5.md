> It's hard coming up with names that are relevant globally...I hesitated to come in on this thread, but now I just can't holdmyself back any longer. This is totally Nasa!!!!!!!toki pona is not a global language and universalism is not one ofit's central principles!given that:(1) almost no other non-toki-ponan concept/word has a singleuniversal toki ponan equivalent.(2) when communicating in toki pona meaning is conveyed not only bywords but also largely by context(3) the division of the year into months is as foreign to tokiponanculture as the precise definition of large numbers...there is no need for all this effort to establish a universalconvention for naming months...heck... if we take something as central to tokiponan culture as abanana, this could be "kili palisa" if you are talking of theconventional banana we usually find in the west, but in certainparts of the world, "kili sike" would be a better description asbananas are more spherical than long and thin. At a marketstall "kili jelo" would be a good way to differentiate it from non-yellow items in the stall, but in a fruit salad, "kili walo" wouldbe a good way to differentiate it from, say, the mango which wouldbe "kili jelo".So I have no problem if tenpo mun pimeja is different in europe andantarctica... and there are several other very good ways ofconveying the time of the year (or if you must, the month) youmean... suno suli, telo mute, telo ala, kili kama are all very goodways of conveying this which will, i admit, vary with context...just like most toki pona words.What then about the original problem... this translation of thisblog software (was it?) into tp... well we all know that tp has twoways of dealing with names of things...(1) adopting words(i.e. "unofficial words") which are tokiponisedand with a capital are to be used imho only for those things whosenames are an essential part of tp culture... personal names,significant place names,etc. imo month names and day names are notsignificant enough to tp to deserve tokiponised adopted words.(2) borrowing words which are usually indicated by the use of quotese.g. jan "George Bush", ma tomo "Barton-on-Sea".So, what is this software being translated from? Probably English...English \_IS\_ the international language of the Internet whether welike it or not... (that is probably why this thread is in English)well then, I would have no problem with tenpo mun "January", tenposuno "Monday"... if that conveys the meaning to the intended party.this does not show weakness in tp. all languages have to cope in asimilar way with concepts that are foreign to their culture. perhapsit is actually a strength of tp that this can be done withoutadulterating its core principles...anyway... i think i have ranted enough now...agneau
