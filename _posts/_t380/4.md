>> Of course, one always adds "tenpo mun" in front of what is in theabove brackets.Sounds good to me. However December is not a dark month in, say,Australia. June would actually be the shortest day in the southernhemisphere, right?I can't think of any suggestions for October, but an alternative forApril could be "tenpo mun kasi nasa" (4/20 - get it?)It's hard coming up with names that are relevant globally...
