you can use oand when you say that somebody wants to, s/he has to :)jan Mimoku2006/8/10, spad0103 <[spad0103@yahoo.fr](mailto://spad0103@yahoo.fr)\
>:Something I would like Sonja to add in her language is a word for "must/have to". The difference between "I have to do it" and "I want to do it" is fundamental. How can I say to a young children "You have to respect this rule", I can't say "sina wile pali sama lawa ni" = "You want to respect this rule"! It's not a question of desire, not always somebody else's will, it's an obligation... --
