I see two ways :- mi kama e ni : meli pi mama sama li tu e linja lawami.- mi toki e ni tawa meli pi mama sama : "o tu e linjalawa mi". ona li pali e ni.This second version is very simple and progressive. Itseems more tokiponese to me than the first.By the way, the same official words list says : "wan"as a noun means "unit, element, particle, part" (not :the whole).In another message, you asked the difference between"li" and "li pi" in a sentence of jan Pije's lessons.Here is the way I see it :kili ni li mi : this fruit is me (=I am this fruit)kili ni li pi mi : this fruit is mineI think, the problem is, you want to translate intoTokipona instead of thinking tokiponese. Languages arenot just communication codes which can be transposedfrom one to another. Languages carry their ownphilosophy, i. e. their own perception of reality. Inthis regard, Tokipona is very peculiar and dealingwith it is, in my opinion, much more acting on oneselfthan learning just another language !jan Kanso\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
