Something I would like Sonja to add in her language is a wordfor "must/have to". The difference between "I have to do it" and "Iwant to do it" is fundamental. How can I say to a young children "Youhave to respect this rule", I can't say "sina wile pali sama lawa ni"= "You want to respect this rule"! It's not a question of desire, notalways somebody else's will, it's an obligation...
