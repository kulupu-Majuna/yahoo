ni li tenpo tu pi toki e toki pona. \[this = (instance 2) OF {talking DIRECT-OBJ toki pona}\]\[this is my second time speaking toki pona\]o pona e ike mi, kulupu pi toki pona."tenpo tu" means 'two times', not "instance 2" or "second instance".  "Second time" is "tenpo pi nanpa tu".   Adding "pi nanpa .." is the normal way to indicate ordinals, which probably shouldn't go higher than 'second'.It's ungrammatical to use "e" in the phrase "pi toki e toki pona".  "pi" can be followed only by noun phrases, and noun phrases can't take direct objects.  You can say "tenpo pi nanpa tu la mi toki e toki pona." ("\[this is\] the second time \[that\] I speak Toki Pona.")If by "kulupu pi toki pona", you are addressing this Toki Pona forum, then I would add "o" after it.  Actually I would switch the two parts, and put a single "o", indicating both addressing the group and issuing the command.stevo
