nasin kepeken sina pi toki pona li pona mute tawa mi.taso mi ken ala sona e ijo. mi wile toki e ni kepekentoki Inli pona mi (in my plain English) :All verbs in the infinitive can be nouns. So they canbe used as nouns, too.In nominal constructions, nouns can be used asgenitives, that is, de facto, as adjectives :tomo telo : bathroom or bathing roomAdjectives can be used as nouns (mi pana e pona tawasina), or as verbs (mi pona)and so on ...So, my question is, are these categories (nouns,verbs, modifiers, ...) really accurate ?On the other hand, they must nevertheless have aspecific function, since in Bliss Symbols, e. g.,there is only one symbol for "oko" and "lukin", resp.for "uta" and "toki" and possibly for "ilo" and"kepeken", toojan Kanso---
