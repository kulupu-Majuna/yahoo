>The official words list says that "jo" and "ken" canbe nouns, too. But "awen" and "kepeken" are not listedas nouns. Nevertheless, I bet You will easilyunderstand the following sentences, in which these twowords are used as nouns :awen pi anpa telo li suli mute tawa jan.kepeken pi ilo ni li musi mute.In my view, every use in any language is correct if itcan be understood without special effort by thelistener or the reader ! Just because languages (evenconstructed) are not only objects of study, but meansof communication, too ...jan Kanso\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
