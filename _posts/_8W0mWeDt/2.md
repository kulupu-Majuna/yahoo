but if that was to occur, there first would have to be a sufficiently  
numerous group of people willing to develop a real encyclopedia on  
everything. And I am personally not sure if this is possible and/or has  
sense at the moment and in case of toki pona.<<  
  
This is true, but on the other hand there are already Wikipedias  
existing in many small languages (e.g. Albanian, several German  
dialects, dead languages like Anglo Saxon etc.). Most of these have  
very little content, and there is hardly any chance that they will  
become real encyclopedias on everything.  
  
The reason for their existence seems to be providing a platform to make  
these small langugages present in the web. So a Wikipedia in toki pona  
makes some sense, too.  
  
Currently, http://tokipona.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipu\_lawa is back up, but  
there is absolutely no content.
