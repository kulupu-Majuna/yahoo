mi pilin e ni: lipu sona Wikipesija lon toki pona li lon ala.  
  
I don't think it would be back up - if you click "edit" you still get  
the message: "This wiki has been closed and the content moved" This is  
the way it has been since the closure, I guess.  
  
Perhaps it would be good for the toki pona wikipedia to be restored, but  
if that was to occur, there first would have to be a sufficiently  
numerous group of people willing to develop a real encyclopedia on  
everything. And I am personally not sure if this is possible and/or has  
sense at the moment and in case of toki pona.  
  
Anyway, being presently an administrator of http://tokipona.wikia.com  
(where the old wiki has been moved - and which I by the way encourage  
you to participate in), I would suppose being informed if another  
movement was to take place.  
  
Yet there is another issue I think should be explored about the present  
site in Wikia: As far as I recall having once read, the conditions of  
removal toki pona from Wikipedia included a statement that  
tokipona.wikia.com will be free from advertising (unlike the usual  
wikias). However, since the last design change (some months ago),  
advertising appears also there - and at least in my point of view it  
disturbs quite a lot.
