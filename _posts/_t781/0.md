Every tp speaker knows that there are proper adjectives instead ofproper nouns, but I'm a having a few problems with them.1) America is "ma Mewika," while an American is "jan Mewika."However, some place-names have been given to people as names, andsome places have been named after people. For example, there is acity in Georgia called Savannah, which would be "ma tomo Sawana", andsome people named Savannah, who would be named "jan Sawana." Butwouldn't "jan Sawana" also mean "a person from the city ofSavannah?" Do you have to say "jan pi ma tomo Sawana," or is thisone of those things that has to be determined by context?2) How do proper adjectives work with yes/no questions? For example,let's say you're looking for someone named Alice. You go to what youthink is her house and knock. Someone answers the door, and you askher, "Are you Alice?"In Toki Pona, would you say:a) sina jan Alisa ala jan Alisa?b) sina jan ala jan Alisa?c) sina jan Alisa ala Alisa?3) If someone introduces another person by title and then by name,how would they do it in Toki Pona? Example: Would "This is mydaughter Amanda" be:a) ni li jan lili mi Amantab) jan lili ni li jan lili mi Amantac) ni li jan lili mi. nimi ona li Amanta.d) ni li jan Amanta. ona li jan lili mi.e) ni li jan lili Amanta mif) ni li jan Amanta lili mig) ni li jan lili mi, jan Amantah) some other combination thereofI'm guessing (c) and (d) would be the best, but does some combinationof the others work?jan Sosuwa
