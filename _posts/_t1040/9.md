>> [http://www.freewebs.com/bonwen/I%27m](http://www.freewebs.com/bonwen/I%27m) curious about your motivation for the particularway you've reduced Toki Pona's phoneme inventory.It looks like you've dropped /s/, /u/, and /i/. If I weregoing to reduce TP's phoneme inventory evenfurther, I would not drop the only fricative, but oneof the phonemes in a category where TP hastwo or three already: /t/ or /m/ or /w/ perhaps.And for maximal contrast of a three-vowel system,I'd make the prototypical values /i a u/ rather than/e a o/.Your website doesn't as far as I can tell say anythingabout Bon Wen phonotactics; I infer from the wordforms I see used that it's basically the same asToki Pona's, right?The grammar isn't thoroughly described yet, butI like what I see so far and would like to see moreof it eventually.--
