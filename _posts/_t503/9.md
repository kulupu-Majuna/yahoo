Peter Jackson; a history of ChristopherColumbus by, I think, jan Pije; and the Tower of Babelstory (don't recall who translated it).I will email you offlist a zip file of the text files. Totalword count is about 8000 words, so only 34kbunzipped. I'll also email the zip to anyone elsewho wants it.I'm planning, when I have time, to dig up some moretext, from earlier years' archives of the listgroupand from the Toki Pona Wikia site. I put togetherthe messages file a year or so ago when I didan analysis of the most frequent phonemes in TP;for this frequent words and phrases analysis Iwanted a larger corpus and I added another 13KBof email text from January-April 2006. BeforeI publish the analysis of the most frequent two- and three-wordphrases I want the corpus to be a good bit larger.--
