If anyone is interested, I've done a few things in and related toToki Pona, and I made a separate page for them. It has two flashanimations in Toki Pona (one of which features the Toki Pona, "siketu li pona".), as well as Tic Tac Toe, with the instructions given inToki Pona. In addition to this, there is a crossword puzzle usingToki Pona vocabulary and some texts that I wrote, as well as a fewother things.This is the URL: [http://www.angelfire.com/empire/almaline/tokipona](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/almaline/tokipona)
