I got tired of misspelling TP words, so I created a custom dictionary for MSWord of all 120 TP words. You can download it from here:[https://aiki.pbworks.com/f/toki+pona.dicTo](https://aiki.pbworks.com/f/toki+pona.dicTo) install it, select Spelling & Grammar from the MS Word Tools menu. SelectOptions and then Custom Dictionaries. Select Add and then browse to the locationof the 'toki pona.dic' file. Hit OK a few times and you are done. This is just asimple text file, so it should work with other word processors.The only minor problem is the Grammar checker highlights the lower case words atthe beginning of each TP sentence as errors! But the Grammar checker can beturned off.Enjoy,Dave
