How do we do them in a clear way?I am in the midst of a translation and come to "All things were made through himand without Himwas not anything made that was made" Uffta! Even if I could unpack the negativesa bit, we stilldon't get a subject for an active "pali" (or whatever). Dare we just assume"pali" is passive aswell as active and put "ali" or "ijo ali" in as subject (and probably "ala" inanother place) andhope that context somehow does the trick: "ijo ali li pali (or "lon")kepekenona. ijo li pali(lon) la ijo li pali ala kepeken ala ona" or so.
