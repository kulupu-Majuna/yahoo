How do we do them in a clear way?  I am in the midst of a translation and come to "All things were made through him and without Himwas not anything made that was made" Uffta! Even if I could unpack the negatives a bit, we stilldon't get a subject for an active "pali" (or whatever). Dare we just assume "pali" is passive aswell as active and put "ali" or "ijo ali" in as subject (and probably "ala" in another place) andhope that context somehow does the trick: "ijo ali li pali (or "lon")kepeken ona.  ijo li pali(lon) la ijo li pali ala kepeken ala ona" or so.I don't think we need passives in Toki Pona.  Make everything active, pick an appropriate subject.  Paraphrase your example above as "People made all things through him.  People made things, and people made no things without Him".In general, I think it's better to start with Toki Pona vocabulary and grammar and see where that can take you rather than with some other language and then try to force Toki Pona into that mold.Toki Pona also has no relative clauses.  This doesn't seem to cause any problems.  Passives are the same way.  stevo / jan Setepo
