Personally, I don't care, and I don'tthink the phonology really changes the spirit of the language thatmuch.The real minimalism in toki pona doesn't come from the number ofpotential words, but the number of actual words, and the simplecontext-driven syntax they are used in.Tweaking the phonology for conlanger aesthetic principles --
 add avowel, add a consonant --
 would be one thing. But it's not a graveenough error to make that kind of systematic change.I'm just saying: systematic incompatible changes to a language in usewill do it major harm. If you don't want to have people use thelanguage, go crazy. If you do, then don't muck with it too much.All that said, I just spent several hours learning toki pona, and Idon't want to have to learn a whole new one. Especially for atheoretic reason that seems all toki lawa.So if toki pona is going to change drastically, change it two daysago. B-)
