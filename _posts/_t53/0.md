Again, I must stress that this is just an "idea". There are noconcrete plans to actually change the phonetics of Toki Pona. But Isee no harm in exploring this idea.If Toki Pona would be converted to a 3-vowel system, here would bethe conversion rules:- e becomes i- u becomes oExcept: je and te which would convert to ja and ta.(This is to avoid an illegal syllable that would lead to an unwantedconsonant change: te
>ti
>si and je
>ji
>(w)i.)I agree that, technically, i-u-a would be more linguisticallysymmetrical than i-o-a.... but Toki Pona favours o, and that is quiteapparent in the language already. u would still be a totallyacceptable allophone of o.mi wile moku e telo mute. ale li pona. pali li ike.would become:mi wili moko i talo mota. ali li pona. pali li iki.Seems to work fine and sounds very cute. But the changes are verysignificant!! People who already speak Toki Pona would have toretrain their Toki Pona ears and tongues (mute
>mota). I'm not sure ifthat is a good idea after all.Sonja
