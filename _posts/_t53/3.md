>> mi wili moko i talo mota. ali li pona. pali li iki.Adam: the difficulty with this is that I really hate trailing 'i' sounds.they make words long and cumbersome. If it was acceptable to 'shorten' the'i' to an 'e' as desired, then I would not have an issue with it (other thanthe annoyance of realearning all that I've gotten so far ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile").Yvonna: I fail to see what it simplifies. The number of vowels and theirpronounciation is very short as it is... shortening the list would only makeit even HARDER to render proper nouns recognizably into TP. I believe thesimplicity gained with the core of TP would be strongly offset by thedifficulty of adapting foreign proper nouns into the language.
