Here's why:0) toki pona li toki pona a! ante suli li palaka e ona. o sina kinpona lili e toki pona.(Toki Pona's is reaching a nice maturity. Big changes will muck thatup. You should just work on fine-tuning the language, rather than1) You're making an unnatural transition with the language (down innumber of vowels rather than up). That's going to make the languagekind of palaka.2) It's going to require a lot more fine tuning afterwards.3) It's kind of an academic change. I mean, is it really the number ofvowels that lends toki pona its unique character? Or is it the verysimple syntax and vocabulary?4) You'll kill any momentum behind the language. OK, it's not likeNewsweek is banging down the door about toki pona, but there arepeople learning it (me included). If you shake now, you'll lose a lotof people, and they won't come back.OK, so, that's my rant. I guess my main point is: I'm not going toenjoy toki pona if it changes radically and frequently.~Iwa
