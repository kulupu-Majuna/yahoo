Toki!From a more practical point of view, one thing I like very much about toki ponais the fact that it invites to play with language. Having only few possibilitiesto say things straightforward, you have to create new ways of expressing them,which is really amusing with a little bit of practice. This is also a typicalaspect of toki pona! Nevertheless, I agree that what Sonja said is veryimportant.Regards,jan [elenitokipona@yahoogroups.com](mailto://elenitokipona@yahoogroups.com) schrieb am 23.02.03 06:54:17:
