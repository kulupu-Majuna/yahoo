Subject: \[tokipona\] translating...  
  
  
Trying my hands on a translation from English  
to tp. How would you revert this back to English?  
I'm curious if the meaning gets across:  
  
ni li ike tawa jan Alis: ona li lon poka telo lili  
li lon poka meli pi mama sama li pali ala.  
meli pi mama sama li lukin e kulupu lipu.  
tenpo mute lili la jan Alis li lukin lili e ona.  
ona li jo ala sitelen.  
  
thank you. Tom.
