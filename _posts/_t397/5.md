toki!I would say, that"mi kin olin e sina" can be used as "everyone loves you,and <I too
> love you""mi olin kin e sina" can be used as "I respect you, andI even love you", or "I <love too
> you", which means "I love you too""mi olin e sina kin" can be used as "I love someone, butI love <you too
>""kin la mi olin e sina" can be used as "Indeed, I love you"or "Moreover, I love you"And, of course, it all depends on context. But I feel that "kin" alwaysrelates to a preceding nest, as every other toki pona word.So, if someone would say "mi olin e sina" to me, I would answer "mi olin kine sina".jan JosaFrom: B.

("Ilove you too." kin modifies the verb here.)Although I can't specifically recall ever seeing itused this way, it might be valid to write "mi kin oline sina." Here, kin modifies the subject. So in Englishyou might say something "I, too, love you."I would encourage that kin modify the verb unless forsome special reason you really want it to modify thenoun. Maybe ask Sonja about it.--
