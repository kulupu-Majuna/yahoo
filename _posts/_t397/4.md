The rule used to be that kin preceded the verb, eventhough it was modifying the verb; it was unlike allnormal TP modifiers. Sonja changed this a little whileback so that kin acts like any other modifier.Therefore, most of the time you'll probably place itafter the verb, although it could come after thesubject if you're wanting to emphasize the subject forsome reason."kin la mi olin e sina" would be \*technically\*correct. We used to use this structure regulary in theTP chat room a long time ago, but Sonja denouncedusing it this way, so we abandoned it.--
