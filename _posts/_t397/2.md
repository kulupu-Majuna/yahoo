Sorry, I don't speak EO, but I think I understand whatyou're asking.The usual way of saying it: "mi olin kin e sina." ("Ilove you too." kin modifies the verb here.)Although I can't specifically recall ever seeing itused this way, it might be valid to write "mi kin oline sina." Here, kin modifies the subject. So in Englishyou might say something "I, too, love you."I would encourage that kin modify the verb unless forsome special reason you really want it to modify thenoun. Maybe ask Sonja about it.--
