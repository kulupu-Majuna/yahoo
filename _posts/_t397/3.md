>jan Pije o! I thought the "kin" had to follow "mi." As in "mi kinolin e sina." To me, "mi olin kin e sina," sounds like "I REALLYlove you," or, "I love you truly." Of course, my toki pona is aheck of a lot spottier than yours, so I'm sure you know what you'retalking about.Also, wouldn't "kin la mi olin e sina" be technically correct,also?-jan Wasolitawa
