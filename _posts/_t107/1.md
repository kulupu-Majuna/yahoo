> But "Uwe" (at least in German) is pronounced with a 'v' sound.That's all right: in Toki Pona w can also be pronounced as a "v".Also, German doesn't have a \[w\], so it would seem quite natural topair up Toki Pona's /w/ with German's /v/ even if they weren't writtenwith the same letter.If you want a precise notion of equality between words in differentlanguages then you have to compare spellings, not sounds, as there isno formula for deciding which sounds in language X correspond to whichsounds in language Y. Still, I wouldn't claim that English "Jan" is agood example of what we're looking for: the first sound of English"Jan" is normally converted to 's' in Toki Pona, and the first soundof Toki Pona "jan" would no doubt be 'y' in English. The "Jan" in mylist was a German "Jan", of course.
