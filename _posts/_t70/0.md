We had just been looking at a Web site about a guynamed Count Grishnackh who wrote songs about crying orcs. Seriously![http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/greven.htm](http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/greven.htm)\]\[BTW, I just used "sike" as a preposition-thing, like "tawa", meaning"about, around, with respect to." I just made it up, comment welcome.\]tan ni la mi pali e toki musi ni. pona!\[So I wrote this poem. I dunno how close I got.

There's a lot of sunlight!The sunlight burns the orc's skin like fire!There's plants here. There's birds here.The birds are singing bird music.That's not good for an orc!The orc wants a human hand in his mouth.The orc is feeling bad.\]Thanks,~YP
