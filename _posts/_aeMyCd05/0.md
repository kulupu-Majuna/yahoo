Lots of little texts we can translate into Toki Pona.

Father, what are those lights?  
  
That is the city of the Goyanim. They are a strange people. They  
light their cities at night, as if the stars weren't sufficient for  
their needs. They fight and kill each other, not realising the  
greater danger beyond their small world. And they do not hunt  
eachother with bows and arrows. No, they have strange devices that  
kill from far away without arrows. And take care near their strange  
iron horses they use to travel. They travel faster than any natural  
beast ought to, and ignore the strength of the bow and arrow. Best if  
you avoid their cities, my son.  
  
Father, whats a city?
