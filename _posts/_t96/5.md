Personally, I think that it iscompletely with Sonja's right to do as she likes on her website, anddictate how she desires the language to go. It is her idea, her site, herresources, her decision, her creation. Nobody is forcing you to use thesame version of TP that she puts on her website... if you want to useanu, go ahead, nobody is stopping you. But 'berating' her for making achoice of what she wants to do with the language is silly.I, the smarter male half of this account, feel differently. Sonja hasa responsibility to the community she created, a responsibility to takethe other speakers of her language into account when deciding the courseof the language, this is no longer a one man boat in an empty sea, shehas brought many passengers onto this journey and though she may be thecaptain it is unkind to change course without consulting the othersaffected by her decision('Smarter half' my ass :p)
