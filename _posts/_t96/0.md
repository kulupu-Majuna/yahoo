One such thing is that the main site for Toki Pona,[http://www.tokipona.org](http://www.tokipona.org), is currently down. But, there are other problems aswell. One such problem is that Sonja has removed the wordfor "or". However, she did so without asking for the opinions of otherspeakers. She only heeded her own desires. I certainly want "or" in our language. When the word for "with"("kan") was removed, it didn't bother me greatly and I did not sayvery much. But now I will speak out. I want "anu"!! Here is anexample of Sonja's new idea: "soweli ken pipi li moku lili?" Howbad! How crazy! If you feel the same way, speak forth! "anu" is good. Help keep it.Thank you,Pije (co-signed by Lament in agreement)
