Even though I am a mere observer and completely new to toki pona, I haveto agree at some point.There is no way to control a living language, like for instance English,German or for that matter my native language, Swedish. It is the speakerswho determine what the language will look like, not teachers oracademies.And frankly, I don't see why the same thing shouldn't go for conlangs. Ican't see the sense in introducing words just to remove them again later.A word that has been created \_is\_ created, and, from my point of view,there is now way to make the creation undone.Best regards- Martin Johsson\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_http://[http://www.websidorna.com](http://www.websidorna.com) - Gratis e-post, dating, webshop.
