The graphics are vaguely reminiscent of Nintendo's TetrisAttack (known as Panel de Pon in Japan). Many of Nintendo's puzzlegames use a sky-blue background.At least in the United States, trademark law provides forremedies only if there is a possibility of confusion. (I don'tknow how Canadian law works, but it should be similar.) Giventhe naming pattern for certain puzzle games such as "Puyo Puyo"and "Baku Baku", and the name of the Super Mario Bros. 2 publicbeta ("Dream Factory Doki Doki Panic"), I don't think anybodywill confuse a clone of Capcom's Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbowith a minimalistic constructed language.But then, the possibility of such coincidences could make a goodcase for adopting richer sets of phonemes. Who's likely to comeup with "Olaetyan", "tlhIngan Hol", or the like?--
