Several of us on the CONLANG mailing list talked recently about  
collectively picking a conlang with few or no speakers yet, but which  
is fully developed enough to be speakable, and learning it together.  
We've created a new mailing list for this project; we'll discuss  
possible conlangs to learn for a while, and then decide on one. You  
can join the mailing list for the project at:  
  
http://lists.conlang.org/listinfo.cgi/conlang\_learners-conlang.org  
  
The thread where Brett Williams first proposed the idea starts  
here:
