Hey everyone.I'm friends with Sonja on livejournal, and found toki pona through there. Onhttp://[http://www.tokipona.org](http://www.tokipona.org), she has listed some online lessons, detailing thelanguage, as her ownlessons are forthcoming in her book. (Did I get that right?)I'm currently using those lessons to learn the language, but have found thelessons, as written,annoying. I think they're well-written for someone who's never touched anotherlanguage, but Iprefer the Klingon Dictionary's method of systematically detailing the variousparts of thelanguage without worrying about actually teaching it.So, as I'm making my way through the lessons, I'm rewriting them. I'm cuttingout what I feel isexcess and rewording for my own, future benefit. I know that some of you wouldcaution me to becareful, so as to not accidentally change the meaning of the rules, and I'dagree. I'm doing whatI can to keep the original text there, only culling the conversational tone.I don't know how long it will take me to finish, as I don't have a lot of timeon my hands, butonce I'm done, would anyone be interested in what I've compiled? I'm keeping itin a .doc, withthe official word list and sonja's extended vocab in a seperate .doc, and willhappily email it towhoever wants a copy. It'd also help to have others look it over, and comment onhow badly Imangled this beautiful langauge.Anyways, that's my intro. Yay.Oh, and I'm Noah, and I'm studying Linguistics at the University of Cincinnati,Ohio, US.Noah \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\\_\_\_\_Park yourself in front of a world of choices in alternative vehicles.
