>But the question is not about a (NSM) definition of "try" but a word for it inconversation. Yourdefinition does not help there much. Of course, I don't much like the thinglanguage foractivities or even achievements. "I try to ..." (not "I try to do ..."). Ithink the Englishdistinction is signifcant generally, so I would look for a modal, possibly"pali" ("work at") butsomething else may work better.
