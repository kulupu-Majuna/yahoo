"Try" has a number of different components in its meaning of 'attempt'."try X" means 1) you have to want to do X, and 2) you do Y to achieve X.  Often, part of the meaning is 3) the implication of failure to achieve X.That's why I suggested the phrasing I did:1) mi wile e ijo.  2) mi pali tawa ona. 3) taso mi kama jo ala e ona.1 could also be "mi wile e ni: mi X", replacing X with whatever you want to achieve.  Is 2 the best way to say "I worked for/toward it"?Is 3 the best way to say "But I didn't get it"?jan Setepo / stevo
