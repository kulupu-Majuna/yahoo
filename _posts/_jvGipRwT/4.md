Maybe \*"reducio ad absurdum" hasn't been translated into toki poka yet. Sigh.  
  
More examples:  
  
Novgorod. Russian town, always transliterated into English, although  
obviously means "New City"  
  
Nuyorican. Portmanteau of New York an Puerto Rican. The "nu" part is  
purely phonetic and doesn't mean new in Spanish or English.
