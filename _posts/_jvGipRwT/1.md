"ma Nuwinli" li pona.  
  
Translating the "new" puts you on the slippery slope of tracking down  
what "England" means as in "land of the Angles" Now Angle comes from  
the word for "narrow", as in "the people who lived by the narrow  
river" So at the bottom of the slippery slope we have "new land of  
the people who live by the narrow river"  
  
Ref. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angeln  
  
ma sin pi jan mute pi telo linja  
  
Or translating what "York" in "New York" means "boar settlement" and  
then trying to translate New York as "new wild boar town"  
  
ma sin pi soweli pi kon jaki
