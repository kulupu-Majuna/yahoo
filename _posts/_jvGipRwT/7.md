"One listens" sounds a bit strange to me. In tp, I would preferably use "jan li kute" or "jan mute li kute", but not "wan", because this "one" actually means an undefined number of people and not just one person. As in French, "on dit" does not mean that only one person says something but that, on the contrary, many people do so. I think that "li kute" won't work at all because "li" is used to separate the subject from the verb. In your example, there is no subject at all, so "li kute" is just "listens" or "is listening", etc. and not a complete sentence.  
When writing these lines I once more feel how difficult it is to explain something using tp. Besides, I'm still not quite sure whether "mi awen pali" means that I interrupt my work or that I continue with it. Any suggestions?

possible translations for the indefinite pronoun...  
  
wan jan li kute. one listens.  
wan li kute. one listens  
ona li kute. one listens. (but also he listens, not sure context  
would make it clear that I'm using an indefinate pronoun)  
jan li kute. one listens. (Still sounds like I have a particular person in mind)  
li kute. one listens.
