Well I just got engaged! I can't believe it, just last year I was beginning tothink i would never meet anyone. I'm 25 already and I thought it was allover. After some recommendations from a buddy I joined up here:[http://www.onlinemeetingplace.info/ktoj](http://www.onlinemeetingplace.info/ktoj) and after 2 weeks I was already meetingup with a beauty. Well, 14 months later and where still together and planningour marriage for later this year =)
