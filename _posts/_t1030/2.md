> What's a good translation for "editor'' in toki pona?I try to avoid discussions of "how do you say "X" in toki pona?" completely outof context. I know how comforting it is to have a complete lexicon with fixedphrases for every possible concept we can think of - and I agree that havingsome standard and immediately recognisable phrases for commonly usedconcepts(even out of context) is probably useful - but creating such adictionary is not in the way of toki pona as I see it.For the particular phrase in quesion here, I think it is possible, even likely,that we would be about an editor in chief after having put the paper/magazines/he is working for in context. If this is case, simply "jan pali" (or "janlawa" for editor in chief) is sufficient to convey the intended meaning. If thecontext isn't there... it might be helpful to establish it.e.g. "my father is editor in chief of the Sunday Times" = "mama mi li jan lawalon lipu "Sunday Times"." (I assume the gender of the father was not relevant inthat conversation)Yes, I know. "Jan lawa" could be the managing director, the owner etc... again Isay "context". If there ws any danger that I would be misunderstood, I might gofor "jan sitelen lawa" (the head writing man). but, as always, the simpler thebetter.jan Sowelilili
