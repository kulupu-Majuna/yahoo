I just want to say how much fun I'm having learningtoki pona. My girlfriend, a non-linguist (it took allweek of a holiday in Germany for her just to learn"Danke" (thank you)) is even learning toki pona now sowe can use it. It's taking ages for her to learn, buteven now we can sit down in a restaurant and she cansay:mi moku e moku ponamoku li ponaand basic sentences like that. I'm thinking for fun attrying a big translation project into toki pona, asthere doesn't seem to be much written in toki ponaapart from a small core of wikipedia stuff (at least Ihaven't found a major quantity of TP texts yet), but Ineed to improve my TP first.Damon\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Win a castle for NYE with your mates and Yahoo!
