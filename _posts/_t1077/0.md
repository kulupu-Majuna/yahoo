Maybe like Toki Pona in simplicity is "wanladigala"[http://wanladigala.pbworks.com/](http://wanladigala.pbworks.com/) ?I have no idea what it is exactly, but the simple idea of one word per syllableis appealing. Maybe a bit like aUI. Every syllable has a meaning and bycombining them you get more complex structures. Could these be called 'semanticprimes'?You could talk about the theory of 'semantic primitives' actually... finding outif those 'primitives' really exist, and, if so, whether they are a useful basefor constructing a language. Answering the question: "Is there a set of semanticprimes possible, one that can serve as the base of a conlang (maybe a list thatis not perfect, but for all practical purposes works fine)?(I know you wrote about Natural Semantic Metalanguage, but looks to me that'snot totally the same, correct me if I'm wrong) I like the idea of reducing language to a form that's as simple as possible,while it still can handle a broad range of meanings and concepts. Topki Pona isso very simple that I cannot get my point accross, it seems. Or can anybody helpme say in Toki Pona:freedomslaveheavyAnd I'm sure there's many more things that are very difficult to say in TokiPona...Maybe if the range in vocab was a bit larger, it would help things? Tom\[Non-text portions of this message have been removed\]
