The last I was informed, one could not put "en" in between adjectivesof a noun (For example, the big bad fish could only be "kala ikesuli" and should never be "kala ike en suli".). How, then, would onesay "the blue and red clothing"? If one tried to follow the rulethat "en" can not be used in between adjectives, one would end upwith "len loje laso," which would actually mean purple clothing,right? A purple shirt is clearly quite different from one thatdistinctly has one half that is red and the other half that is blue.Should "en" be allowed to serve as a buffer between adjectives innecessary situations such as these? Or has the use of "en" like thisalready been established without my being informed?Also, I recently posted several questions to the board which werenever answered. In effect, I will be re-posting them here now. Iintend to attach these questions to every post I make from now onuntil they are answered:1. Can "pini" be expanded to be an interjection, meaning "finally!"or "at last!"?2. Is there a difference between "ijo pi nanpa wan" and "ijo nanpawan" to mean "the first thing"? If so, which one is better to use?3. Is the sentence, "o pana e ilo moku tawa mi la mi ken moku"possible (It would mean, "Give the utensil to me so that I can eat.")?--
