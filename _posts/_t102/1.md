kala ike suli = bad fish that is big; big bad fishI suppose you could say:len pi loje en laso = clothing that is "red and blue"Note that since purple is "laso loje" (reddish blue) or "loje laso"(bluish red), therefore:len pi laso loje = purple clothinglen loje laso = a "red shirt" that is blueNot sure how to interpret this one. Maybe the shirt is dominantly redbut also has blue in it. Maybe it's a red shirt covered in blue paint.:PUsing "en" twice is still permitted as a way to emphasize "both/and"en sina en mi li kama. = both you and I come1. Can "pini" be expanded to be an interjection, meaning "finally!"or "at last!"?Of course. I might even say "pini a!"2. Is there a difference between "ijo pi nanpa wan" and "ijo nanpawan" to mean "the first thing"? If so, which one is better to use?I suppose they mean the same, but "ijo nanpa wan" is used wherease theother is not. "nanpa" is a special word and "pi" is not necessary.3. Is the sentence, "o pana e ilo moku tawa mi la mi ken moku"possible (It would mean, "Give the utensil to me so that I can eat.")?Yes roughly. Although I would use 2 separate sentences. "o pana e onatawa mi. mi wile moku." The link between wanting a fork and needing toeat is pretty obvious, and you are only making the sentence structureunnecessarily complex in your example.Sonja/Marraskuu
