"sitelen musi toki pona li pona"would that be a reasonable way to say "toki pona comics are good"?"sitelen musi" seems reasonable for comics (or should it simply be"sitelen" - is the "musi" redundant/unnecessary?)but i'm not sure if appending "toki pona" to it is the correct way tosignify "comics that are written in toki pona".russ
