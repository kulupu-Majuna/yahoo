I'm still struggling eith the idioms of thislanguage, so thanks for the translation; I don'tthink I would have gotten there without it. Forgetting idioms down, here are the things I hadtrouble with and I would thank anyone who canexplain why I am not getting it.I guess a language type picture is as right orrighter (but I am having trouble maybe with NAorder?) as/than a picture language , 'tokisitelen,' which is what I went back to look forwhen I didn't get 'sitelen toki,' which I read as"writing in a language."I have gotten 'tawa' in my head as "to" but Iknow it moves beyond simple direction, mainly inthe same way English "to" and that move includesthe dative as in "give to," but I didn't get fromthere to the dative "for" as in "make ~ for tokipona." What are the limits on 'tawa'?The next sentence really threw me "Make that likeme talking" or some suvch. Can someone explainhow this goes together (I suspect there are rightgroupings here that I don't see --
 or rather thatare different from the ones I used).The translation gets a little free with theclause: "This is a good picture/drawing" --
"ideography" by context.I read the next as "Not me made all the pictures"--
 I suppose the 'ala' modifes 'pali,' when canit precede?The two pages which offer to rewrite names orphrases are not working at the moment (well,maybe half an hour ago now).Does the name writer use a syllabary over anabove the ideography? There aren't ideogramscporresonding to all the syllables, just many ofthe words.The iconography involved here doesn't match mysense of iconicity; are there some principles forthe construction of the symbols? Many of themseem similar enought that I looked for patternsin the differences but I am afraid I don't get it(either, alas).---
