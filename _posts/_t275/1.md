It looks like you were saying that TP should only have a period andexclamation point. True, TP can get by with only a period, but it ismore common (from what I've seen) to use colons and sometimescommas. It just makes the reading a lot easier and it flows better.From a standpoint of simplicity, it is easier for the writer to useonly periods but easier for the reader to have periods, colons, andcommas.I do disagree with you in saying that only period and exclamationpoint are necessary. If we were trying to get rid of unnecessarypunctuation, my first choice would be the exclamation point, sincevocative and imperative are shown inherently with "o".-jan Kowijan lawa pi lipu "www.tokipona.bravehost.com"o lukin e lipu mi!
