toki !mi wile e ni : jan Sonja anu jan Pije li pana e pilin ona tawa mimute lon ni :There is something unclear about mi, sina and li.Li is not used after mi and sina : "mi pona.", "sina tawa." etc ...But after "mi mute", li is used (even by jan Sonja herself, messageN° 348). So, "mi tu li" and "mi ali li" should be correct, too.But what with "mi ala", "mi kin" or "mi taso" ?I think, in order to avoid comprehension difficulties, the ruleshould be interpreted in a very restrictive way : drop li if it isplaced immediately behind mi or sina used as subjects of the verb.In all other cases, put li.There is something unclear, too, about lon and tawa as verbs,followed by the prepositions lon resp. tawa.e. g. : mi lon ma Piten. mi tawa ma tomo Paki.But what in the negative form : mi lon ala (lon ?) ma Piten. mi tawaala (tawa ?) ma tomo Paki.And what if lon and tawa have other modifiers ?mi lon pona (lon ?) ma Piten.mi tawa taso (tawa ?) ma tomo Paki.Here, too, I think the rule should be interpreted in a veryrestrictive way : after the verbs lon and tawa, drop theprepositions lon resp. tawa in order to avoid the sequences "... lonlon ..." and " ... tawa tawa ...". In all other cases, put thepreposition.jan ijo li jo e pilin pona e pilin sona lon ni la o toki !jan Kanso
