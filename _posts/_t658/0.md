There is something unclear about mi, sina and li.Li is not used after mi and sina : "mi pona.", "sina tawa." etc ...But after "mi mute", li is used (even by jan Sonja herself, message N° 348). So, "mi tu li" and "mi ali li" should be correct, too.But what with "mi ala", "mi kin" or "mi taso" ?I think, in order to avoid comprehension difficulties, the rule should be interpreted in a very restrictive way : drop li if it is placed immediately behind mi or sina used as subjects of the verb. In all other cases, put li.Even better:  use "li" all the time, with no exceptions.jan Setepo / stevo
