> Understood. I took your remark as indicating that you thought theexceptions should be done away with.That's what I think about the "li" exception. I'm afraid themisunderstandig is caused because my English lacks many nuances. I'llsay my opinion in other words: I think things would be a bit easierand clearer in TP without the "li" exception.

For example: My Esperanto is very good.It would be a pain for me to use it with only the "Unua Libro" rootsit had in 1887, or with the "Fundamento" roots of 1905. I would needa dictionaty at first to be sure, but I could achieve that. It wouldbe a good mental exercise to say "homlevilo" instead of "lifto"...But anyway every esperantist will understand me. If the main thingfor me is to use the language that way, I can create a group to talkthat way with other people. We could make it a kind of "let's see howfew words we need" game and reduce the vocabulary month after month.That is not and was not the Esperanto goal, but I can use thelanguage for that if I wish.The question about TP is that a goal like that is \*the\* (only?) goal.But, as in my example, if TP would have more language tools, everyone could still use it to pursue that original goal.
> A fair number at least just like a constructed language they
> can learn in a day (or so)/If you can learn a language in one day, many things have to be leftout of it, and many others (mainly grammar) has to remain unclear andunsolved. I would prefer the language would be more... how tosay? "complete"?, study it in one month and have no unsolved grammarproblems and no constraints (and no exceptions too:).When I say "complete" I don't mean "vocabulary rich". I don't need asingle word to say "recumbent" or whatever ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") I can use a two orthree or four words expression with help of the context, and it isone of the reasons the language is easy to learn and use. I mean, thevocabulary is not the main thing here.

> those would be a start.Your question makes me think that digits names alone would solve manythings but wouldn't be enough to read and write other things. I'mafraid that the next "step" would be unavoidable. I mean, other TPpeople would request names to read "=", "+", "-", "/"... And then whynot other words too?Would it lead to a kind of "modular" TP in which everyone would haveto notify the speakers or readers: "This TP speech/text of minerequires modules 'TP digit numbers 1.0' and 'TP maths 1.2' ![:-D](images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy") Whatnext? "TP soweli Aflika module 1.4"? :-)I'm not sure. The sure thing for me is that it's a pity that, whilethe language has so much potential, the initial goal avoids to use itin wider contexts for people that would like to do so.jan Mako--
