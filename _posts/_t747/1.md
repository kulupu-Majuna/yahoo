So far as I can tell, using "li"with "sina" and"mi" is not illegal, just unnecessary (I wouldn't mind extending the permissionto drop to "ona"and "ni" to make the rule a little easier).

 or a useful trick for learning thelanguage (indeed, itis how we always learn language, I think) but there seems to be a significantpsychological (atleast) difference between learning some bits that are known to be only a part ofthe whole andlearning th same bits as the whole. The former has a build in escape from theinexpressible ingoing to the fuller corpus or to free coinage, the latter does not. So theconcentrationexpressing everything in these given terms becomes more intense --
 andpresumably more effective. That is, with tp (or anything that fits this program) it becomes not a game buta spiritualexercise.

To now, nothing has appeared tobe missing. Noone operates with what is given in an optimal way yet, but that is not evidencwethat changes oradditions are needed. What is unclear/unsolved is not grammar but interpretationand whatregularly appears to be missing there is an appreciation of the range ofpossibilities, to seewhich of the meany fits the context best. Of course, context doesn't alwaysdecide on the rightone --
 but then it doesn't always in any language (even in Lojban, once all thegrammar is done,the question of wehat is meant may still remain unsettled --
 though that is alot rarer than in alanguage where different parsings are possible).

 youcan learn enoughfor 99% of the cases in a day or less. But the vocabulary typically takes halfa year and isshakey even then. The remaining one percent of the cases (and fifty percent ormore of thegrammar) is tied up in vocabulary: the half-dozen types of logical connectives,for example. OrMEX (relevant to tp?). Lojban has set the goal of being parsed withoutreference to humanintuition or non-verbal context. that does not seem to be a goal that manylanguages require;certainly one intended for human communication does not need it as long asquestions of meaningand devices for paraphrase are available.

Wordsfor mathematical oeprations will come as needed (or else the claim that tp canexpress everythinghas to be revised --
 which I doubt). The question is just whether we want a wayto read numeralsor a way to express numbers: the first is easy (although we might have to fightabout the words touse --
 if each used his own language's confusion might ensue), the secondrequires some changes inthe grammar; number strings do not group like other modifiers (not that thatgrouping is entirelyclear --
 or perhaps it is not clear what strings are in fact modifier stringsand what somethingelse, i.e., parsing is not unique).

The interesting questions are what the changes areand which onewins out when they conflict (actually, they both do but usually because therecome to be twolanguages).I take it that you are in some version of the expansionist camp.
