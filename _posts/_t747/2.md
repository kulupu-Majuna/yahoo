I suspect that if a lot of people used Toki Pona for their primary language whenever possible that 1) they would become fluent in it very quickly (duh!), and 2) they would find the areas of the language that really need improvement. Someone said it before, but I'll rephrase it. Â Exhaust the resources of the language before suggesting "fixes".jan Setepo / stevo
