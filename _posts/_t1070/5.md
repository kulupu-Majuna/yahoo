The phrase 'much time ago he didnot die' is one side. The phrase 'this time he died' is another side. \]So to indicate that someone has died, I should use 'kama moli'?

>> \*'ona li jan Wapa' anu ' nimi ona li nimi 'Wapa.' nimi li jan ala. nimi'Wapa' li sona e seme kepeken toki Inli.\['he is Bob' or 'his name is the word Bob'. The name is not the person. The word'Bob' is what using English.\]I translated Bob or Robert as Wapa in tp. Is this ok?I believe one translation of 'sona e' is 'to know how to'. I wasn't sure how totranslate it in your comment above.

>> \*anu 'tomo tawa li tawa tomo pi pona sijelo e jan Wapa'\[or 'the car moved Bob to the hospital'\]So putting the location (hospital) immediately after the word tawa is betterbecause then I don't have to use tawa again later? I remember reading somewherethat tawa tawa is absorbed into a single tawa.

>> \*jan ni li jo ala e sijelo sona. tenp mute la sijelo li sona ala. tan i lasina wile kulupu 'jan pi sona (anu pona) sijelo'\[this person does not have body knowledge. Many times the body knows nothing.Because of this, you want the phrase 'man of knowledge of the body' (orknowledge of fixing the body).\]I understand what you are saying here. I have to be careful of the order ofadjectives and the words they modify.
> taso ijo ona li open ala. kulupu mama mi li tawa tomo pi pona sijelo.
> jan pi sijelo sona li toki e nimi ike tawa mi mute. ona li toki E ni: jan Wapali moli.
>> \*sin la. kin la sina wile e nimi 'e.'\[sin la? maybe you want the word 'e'\]Yes, I forgot the object separator 'e'.What does the idiom 'sin la' mean?
> mi mute li pilin ike. mi mute li pana e oko
> telo.
>> \*'telo oko' lon la oko li telo. taso ona li pana e oko.\[If there is 'eye water', then the eye waters. But it gives the eye.\]I see my order of adjective and noun was backwards again. We gave water of/fromthe eyes - we cried.
> tenpo lili la mi mute li awen poka sijelo pi jan Wapa.
>> \*mi sona ala. taso mi filin e ni: sina wile kepeken e kulupu 'lon poka.'\[I don't know. But I think this: you wish to use the phrase 'at the side'.\]I see now that the verb 'awen' just means we remained but it doesn't give thelocation; so I need to use 'lon poka' to indicate 'at the side' of Bob.
> meli pi jan Wapa li weka e sike wan tan luka pi jan Wapa.
>> \*pakala! mi sona ala e kulupu ni. kulupu Inli 'His wife hugged him' li lon allon. anu kulupu 'She took a ring from his hand'
>\[I do not understand this phrase. Is it the English phrase 'His wife huggedhim'? Or the phrase 'She took a ring from his hand'\]I was trying to say that she 'removed the wedding ring from his hand'. I threwin 'wan' to indicate a 'uniting' ring.
> mi toki e jan lili tu mi.
>> \*jan lili li nimi ala. tan ni la sina ken ala toki e ona. sina wile kulupu'toki tawa jan lili mi'\['jan lili' is the wrong word. This is why you cannot talk them. You want thephrase 'speak to my children'.\]I understand. I speak words. I cannot speak children. I speak TO the children.
> ona li pana e oko telo.
>> \*'telo oko'Same mistake as I made above.
> mi sike e ona.
>> \*mi sona ala. taso mi filin e ni: toki sina li lon. a! kulupu ni li nimi Inli'hug'\[I do not understand. But I think this: your talk is this. This phrase is theEnglish word 'hug'.\]Yes, I was trying to say 'I hugged them' or 'I circled them'. Is this ok?
> mi mute li pali e sona tawa lukin sijelo.
>> \*lon ni la nimi 'sona' li seme. ken la 'kulupu'\[here the word 'knowledge' is what? Maybe group?\]I was trying to say we made 'plans' for the wake / viewing. Can I use 'sona' for'plans'?
> meli pi jan Wapa li wile e poki sijelo. jan li telo e sijelo. jan li pana esijelo lon poki sijelo.
>> \*ken la 'li lon poki sijelo e sijelo' nimi 'pana' li pona ala tawa mi\[maybe 'in the casket the body' the word 'put' is not good to me. \]I was trying to say the 'undertaker put the body into the casket'. I couldn'tthink of a word for 'undertaker' so I used jan for person.Is it true that the prepositional phrase usually comes after the direct object? Or should the PP come directly after the verb?
> kulupu mama mute en jan pona mute li kama tawa lukin sijelo. ona mute li panae kasi kule mute. ona mute li pilin ike. jan li open ala e poki sijelo. mi muteli pana e oko telo.
>> \*sin la.
>> kulupu mama en jan pona li kama kulupu lon tomo sewi. jan luka en mi li tawa epoki sijelo lon tomo sewi.
>> \*'tawa tomo sewi e poki sijelo'\[ 'moved the casket to the church'\]So I was correct in thinking that tawa in this sentence is a transitive verbwhich takes casket as a direct object? But I don't need the extra 'lon' for 'at'the church because the tawa takes care of this? I'm confused.
> mi mute li kute e kalama musi pona. jan sewi lili li toki e nimi pona sike janWapa.
>> \*kulupu 'jan sewi' li pakala' ona li sona e ijo tu. tan ni la toki sina lipona. taso mi sona ala e ni: kulupu 'toki sike' li lon tawa kulupu Inli 'talkabout.'\[The phrase 'jan sewi' is a mistake. It means 2 things. This is why yourcommunication is good. But I do not know this: the phrase 'toki sike' is theEnglish phrase 'talk about'\]Yes, I was trying to say 'the minister spoke good words about Bob.'
> ona toki ni: moli ala li lon kon sewi.
>> \*jan sewi lili sona ala sona e ni: jan Wanpi en jan Sonpi li lon kon sewi. mipilin e ni: sina wile e kulupu 'ona li moli ala. ona li lon kon sewi.'\[Does the priest know about this: person Wanpi and person Sonpi are in theheavens? I think this: you want the group 'he is not dead. he is in heaven.'\]Wanpi and Sonpi ??I was trying to say 'there is no death in heaven' but I could break it up into 2sentences as you suggested.

>> \*mi sona ala. mi pilin e ni: kulupu ni li lon ala. taso mi ken ala toki enimi tan pi pilin ni.\[I don't know. I think this: this group does not exist. But I cannot speak theword from thinking this.\]I was trying to say 'sleep in peace' - sleep in all that is good.
> jan mute li tawa tomo mi. ona mute li moku e moku e telo nasa. jan li toki etenpo pini sike jan Wapa.
>> \*pakala 'sike' sin. sina ken ala ken toki e tenpo. tenpo li nimi ala.\[Messed up 'sike' again. You cannot speak time. Time is not a word\]Yes, I see now, people can't speak time. I was trying to say 'the people spokeabout past times with Bob'.Maybe I should have written 'jan li toki sike tenpo pini poka jan Wapa' ?
> moli li ala.
> mi tawa tomo poka.
>> \*ken la sina en e nimi 'taso' \[Maybe you want the word 'taso' - 'but'\]
> tenpo pini la seme mi mute li lon. mi mute li lon kin.
>> \*I gotta do this in English. 'Whatever' is not 'seme' which just asks aquestion, whereas 'whatever' is a generalization. I want to say "We were manythings to one another and we are those things still" but 'one another' stops me.I guess, "I was many things to you and you were many things to me and we stillare." Of course, "be many things to" is no snap either.I guess I should stick to simpler topics! <grin
