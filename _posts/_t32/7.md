toki

I think numbers are importand for basic comunications. For example
appointments. How do you say "Let 's meet 9:30 pm"?.\
I think it is ok to say it only quarters of hours. But we need mubers
for this.\
Maybe a lot of people will use toki pona then you can't stop the use
of numbers.\
I think it is good to use a number system as the same as Esperanto.\
Only 10 Words.
