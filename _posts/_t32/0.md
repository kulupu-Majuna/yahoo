If you would like to talk about complexthings you have to use English for international communication.But I found an other advantage. toki pona is good to handle with acomputer. It is not too difficult to create a text editor with syntaxhighlighting for toki pona. Spell checking is very easy and a speechsynthesiser has only to give out wave-files for every word. A computercan easy analyse the structure of the sentences. Easy than Esperanto.I have started to learn toki pona but I didn't found some every dayphrases. This follow URL show every day word for many languages (incl.the artifical languages Esperanto and Eurisch:[http://travlang.com/languages/Why](http://travlang.com/languages/Why) not toki pona?But I thing this version can't handle with numbers and time. But maybein a newer version.Ro
