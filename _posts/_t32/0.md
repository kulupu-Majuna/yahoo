Hi,
\- what is "hi" in toki pona? -

I like the idea of toki pona. This is a very easy and cute language.
It is not necessary to have complex language for personal
international communication. If you would like to talk about complex
things you have to use English for international communication.

But I found an other advantage. toki pona is good to handle with a
computer. It is not too difficult to create a text editor with syntax
highlighting for toki pona. Spell checking is very easy and a speech
synthesiser has only to give out wave-files for every word. A computer
can easy analyse the structure of the sentences. Easy than Esperanto.
I have started to learn toki pona but I didn't found some every day
phrases. This follow URL show every day word for many languages (incl.
the artifical languages Esperanto and Eurisch:

Why not toki pona?

But I thing this version can't handle with numbers and time. But maybe
in a newer version.
