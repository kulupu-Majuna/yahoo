It's un-\<pona\> to break the day that fine. One would say something
more along the lines \<tenpo pimeja la mi lukin e sina\> = "let's meet
after dark."

> I think it is ok to say it only quarters of hours.

Dividing the day and night up into 96 units? Blecch. Not simple.
Not cute. Not \<pona\>.

If you want Esperanto, you know where to find it ;-)
