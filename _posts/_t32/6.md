Don't count on it. Sonja says large integers are artificial.

T: Is Juuitchan's anti-TP ranto warranted? [http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/talk:Toki_Pona_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Toki_Pona&oldid=100661)\
M: interesting rant\
M: but i dont feel that this person really understands toki pona\
M: obviously TP is not for him\
M: it doesnt suit his way of thinking\
T: how does one build a house without large numbers?\
M: why do you need numbers?\
T: to measure the proportions of the lengths of things\
T: or are you thinking along the lines of some sort of Euclidean constructionist geometry?\
M: i dunno\
M: TP is not a real language for primitives to use\
M: it's a language to help us minimize our thoughts and focus on a more natural and healthy life and priorities\
T: so are you saying Juuitchan was on the right track? "but as a sort of filter: 'Can I say this in Toki Pona'"\
M: yes it is a filter\
M: it's a therapeutical filter\
M: if you cant say it easily in TP it's prolly not a healthy thought\
T: so the thoughts that go into building a first-person shooter aren't healthy?\
M: it's a concept beyond the core basic values of life\
M: it's artificial\
M: if we lived as real foragers we wouldnt need computer games to entertain ourselves\
M: we'd really live life\
M: im not saying we should become foragers tohough\
M: TP is just a guide\
T: the four basic needs: food, water, clothing, shelter\
M: it's not a strict code or anything\
M: also: love, sex, friends\
M: work, fun\
T: shelter... construction... measurement... numbers... O(n)...\
M: moku, telo, len, tomo, olin, unpa, jan, pali, musi\
M: tp is just a tool\
M: to guide our thoughts in the right direction\
M: it's not an authority on what should and should not exst in life\
M: i feel like i shouldnt have to defend this to you\
T: i feel like i have to defend this to the world\
T: and I need ammo\
M: i see\
M: well do you understand what i mean?\
T: sort of\
M: i am a bit tired right now so maybe i dont have the energy to go on\
T: i'll wait until you have a more detailed response to Juuitchan\
M: i think if we respond in details to everyones criticism, its very un-TP\
M: we are playing the same checkmate game as them\
M: TP lets go; it doesnt try to explain and create problems\
M: it just focuses on the simlpe good things that are universal\
M: there is no use for arguments; they are "toki utala"\
M: TP is just a concept like any other\
M: some will like it; some wont like it\
M: you can pick it apart up to a certain point\
M: but beyond that you are just looking for problems that dont exist\
T: so the problem of "how to build a house" doesn't exist?\
T: that's about the only remaining problem I can still see\
M: i'm sure i can build a basic house without needing advanced math\
M: you either have enough (mute pona) bricks or you dont\
M: or branches or whatever\

M: iglus never required advanced math\
T: I begin to get it\
M: advonced math is a tool you only need if you live in a complicated world\
M: and the world is quite simple really\
M: it's just modern humans that have made everything so complicated and artificial in their lives\
T: How does one ask "how?" in TP?\
M: nasin seme\
M: what way\
