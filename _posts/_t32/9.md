Toki Pona is very deliberately designed to be minimalistic. As few words as
possible to explain all the things that matter... to Sonja. Remember
that Toki Pona was NOT created to be a useful, every day language for
everyone. It was created as a hobby for Sonja and her roommate with the
specific agenda of making a language so simple that it is difficult to
express complicated ideas... ideas that are not within the Tao.
I think the language is cute and fun, and I am making an honest effort to
learn it... though I do not hold to Sonja's belief structure. But I do
understand the bias of the language, and accept it. Do not try to change
Toki Pona just because it cannot do what you want it to... it was not
DESIGNED to do what you are asking, not as a flaw, but as a feature.
If you wish to learn an easy, general purpose language, Esperanto is a more
suitable choice for you. If you want to learn a cute, but limited language
only used by a few dozen people in the world, then Toki Pona may be your
choice (there are other mini-languages that you may wish to look at though).
But accept the limitations of TP before you suggest 'improvements.'
