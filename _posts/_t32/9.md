Rememberthat Toki Pona was NOT created to be a useful, every day language foreveryone. It was created as a hobby for Sonja and her roommate with thespecific agenda of making a language so simple that it is difficult toexpress complicated ideas... ideas that are not within the Tao.I think the language is cute and fun, and I am making an honest effort tolearn it... though I do not hold to Sonja's belief structure. But I dounderstand the bias of the language, and accept it. Do not try to changeToki Pona just because it cannot do what you want it to... it was notDESIGNED to do what you are asking, not as a flaw, but as a feature.If you wish to learn an easy, general purpose language, Esperanto is a moresuitable choice for you. If you want to learn a cute, but limited languageonly used by a few dozen people in the world, then Toki Pona may be yourchoice (there are other mini-languages that you may wish to look at though).But accept the limitations of TP before you suggest 'improvements.'Yvonna
