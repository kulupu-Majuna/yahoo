Microsoft Word manages to do some primitive analysis on English text;
otherwise, it wouldn't be able to grammar-check or auto-summarize a
document. If it can be done for Toki Inli, it can surely be done for
Toki Pona.

If you can come up with some examples of sentences where the
meanings of \<tawa\> cause ambiguity, then you will get your name
on my page about Toki Pona, perhaps next to a cute little bomb.

Or Sonja might just step in and clarify how to parse \<tawa\> as
she did for \<ala\>. (In IRC, sSonjahe explained that unlike most other
modifiers, \<ala\> = "not" modifies the word immediately preceding it.)
