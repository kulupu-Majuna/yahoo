Hence the confusion I had when learning Toki Pona. 'tawa' was never
explained to be a word that broke the rules... I had to read many examples
on the lessons and in IRC before I realized that the word 'tawa' was used
differently than the others... perhaps I should have realized, but Toki Pona
was so simple otherwise that I truly could not believe that they would have
added a word that broke the rules.
