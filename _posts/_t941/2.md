Well, less pejoratively, one can se 'poka open' for 'left'(the side you start writing and marching on) and so 'loka pini' for 'right', but that is culture bound, as are the ones that use the words for 'west' and 'east' (also controversial).  Somewhat better culturally are 'poka wawa' for 'right' and 'poka wawa ala' for 'left' but not everyone is right-handed or stronger on the right even if they are. Something involving the side where the hear is would be nice --
 if we had a compact word for 'heart' other than 'insa' which is confusing in this context as well as not pointing to th right heart.  Make up something and we will add it to the list. (as we just did with jan Setepo's).-----
