I would appreciate to be mentioned as an additional supporter, too ![8-)](images/smilies/icon_cool.gif "Cool")) Helmut Voigt, Berlin/Germany: [akesi_palisa@yahoo.de](mailto://akesi_palisa@yahoo.de) pona! jan Elumutu Marcos Cramer <[marcos.cramer@gmail.com](mailto://marcos.cramer@gmail.com)\
> schrieb: toki!Sorry for writing in English...As has been discussed on this list before, it can be useful for Toki Pona to have an ISO 639-3 code. For example, that would mean that Toki Pona gets included on omegawiki.org, a wiki dictionary database.jan Mimoku (AJK) and I have filled in the application form for an ISO 693-3 code. Before I send it to the ISO 639-3 Registration Authority, it would be great if others could have a look at it to see if anything can be improved on the form. You can view the filled in form at [http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhk9ndb5_17fk77cn](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhk9ndb5_17fk77cn) I am mentioned as the primary requester, and jan Mimoku is mentioned as an additional supporter of the request. It would be great to have a few more additional supporters. So let me know if you propose any changes to the form, or are want to appear as an additional supporter.jan Moku Yahoo!
