Toki Pona was never intended to be workable in allsituations, only in certain ones. That is why it doesnot have numbers. I would like to mention two quotesfrom tokipona.org that I think are applicable here:"In our modern times, we seem to make life socomplicated, and it is easy to lose touch with ourbasic origins. Indeed, they say that most of life'sproblems we create ourselves, e.g. in our frenetic andalways accelerating quest for 'progress'."and "Toki Pona is a minimal language..."If you really want to talk about complex topics, use acomplex language.Pije\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!
