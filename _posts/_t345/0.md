Greetings all,Mi nimi Damon. mi lon ma Kinla ma tomo katifu (Cardiff- I tokiponaised it from the Chinese rendering ofCardiff, Kadifu).I'm sorry for not writing more in toki pona, but I'mstill working on learning it. (And toki Anjo, I'msurprised to see that we have the same linguisticinterests!).I'm surprised that there exists no real method ofexpressing numbers greater than about fourteen. I lovethe method expressed in toki pona; it's cute.But I'm sure that if one were to translate a documentinto a language, precise numbers must need toexpressed at some point. From what I understand ofGreenlandic, for example, they use Greenlandic numbersup as far as twelve, as G-ic has no numbers greaterthan that. For larger numbers, they use Danish. Ithought the idea of a workable language would be thatit would be so flexible that you could translateanything into it (although I don't fancy a discussionor writing an essay in toki pona discussingmacro-economics of the Greenlandic fishing industry).;)Temon (Damon),Katifu, Kinla.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ALL-NEW Yahoo!
