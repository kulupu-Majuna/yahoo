jan Siwen, toki! Thanks for going over my attempts. :DI was trying to say "when I was looking at the Omniglot page," where lukin wassupposedto be a verb, but I guess I couldn't be THAT ambiguous there. I think a lot interms ofJapanese grammar, where verbs don't always need subjects and dependent clausesare putright in front of the word they modify. So, in order to say something likethis, I'd have toput it in an entirely different sentence, as you said:
> "mi lukin e toki pi tomo palisa Pape suli lon lipu Omniglot."Doing that would establish a context, which is ideally what I want, right? Asfor Omniglotbeing an unofficial word, I didn't tokiponize it because it would have turnedout likeOnikulo and would've been not understandable without some sort of translation,so I left itlike that. ike ike. I'm guessing that I shouldn't establish too many timephrases if acontext is already set, right?

> 
> taso pilin "leko" li pilin sona ala.
>> "taso mi sona ala e nimi "leko"."Gotcha. I was trying to say "but the meaning of 'leko' is an unknown meaning." I guess Ireally need to resort to direct actions of knowing more.

But I do seeyour point here. I guess I was just being redundant...now that I think aboutit, I ought tocut down my words I already said :X
> 
>ona li ken, la mi pilin pona.What I was trying to say in that "If someone can, then I would feel good." Ithought I coulddo if-then statements using la and two sentences like that.
> 
> en, jan seme li pali sitelen e toki pona kepeken sitelen pi sitelen Inliala?I will admit that I didn't know if I could use 'en' here. As for 'palisitelen,' I meant 'didwriting,' or tried to write. It's where you attempt to do something by doingthe action andnot simply acting. I didn't know if I could do that sort of thing. What Imeant was "whohas tried to write toki pona with a writing system that isn't English?" Ididn't know if thatwould turn out right.

> I think that "sitelen" doesn't mean the language as a tool. I would
