Thatis, what words weuse are a function of what we want to say in a given situation, not of what thereferent IS insome universal sense. For the diving bird cases. I do think they are stillbirds, but that may bea factor of the relatively short amount of time spent diving (of course,chickens are birds buthardly fly at all). Maybe the crucial thing for waso is having wings, notactually using them.But then penguins are a problem â€“ are those really wings? I think thestruthiocameloids escapethis proble like chickens do, Penguins may be soweli or even kala.
