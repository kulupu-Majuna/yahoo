Oh, I see what you're saying. You wish "la" worked in pairs, likequotation marks, or like Spanish question marks.SonjaAnother way to do it is to put "la" at the beginning of its phrase, just as "li" and "e" mark the beginning of predicates and objects, and then optionally (or not) mark the end of the phrase. Â In other words, beginning "la" the main one.Following "la"s could also (or instead) mark additional such phrases.jan Setepo / stevo
