If you have found any flaws or problem areas or ambiguous areas thatneed to be worked on in Toki Pona, please email the details to medirectly at [sonja@kisa.caI](mailto://sonja@kisa.caI) will take your findings into consideration in writing the Toki Ponabook as I make small adjustments to the language.I have trouble with "la" at the end of a phrase or sentence.  I suggest adding a second "la" at the beginning to warn of the following "la"-phrase, while retaining the "la" at the end to mark the end of the phrase.  jan Setepo / stevo
