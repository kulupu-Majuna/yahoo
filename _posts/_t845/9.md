If we put "la" only at the beginning of a "la"-phrase,how would we know where the la-phrase ends and the subject begins?And I don't see the advantage of having a pair of "la" particles to delimitthe phrase.  Maybe jan Setepo can clarify his ideas further.Introducing a la-phrase with "la" would be consistent with the other particles (li, e) which precede their respective parts of a sentence.  Ending the la-phrase with "la" would continue to serve its present function of marking the end of the la-phrase.  jan Setepo / stevo
