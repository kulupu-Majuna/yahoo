Hi, I want to start a topic that would be endless but would give somelegitimity to toki pona. Here [http://www.uld3.org/](http://www.uld3.org/) and here [http://mulivo.pbwiki.com/Wordsyou](http://mulivo.pbwiki.com/Wordsyou) will see to application of the Roget classification(here:[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Roget_Thesaurus_Classification](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Roget_Thesaurus_Classification)), that summarize the basic needed words in any language. I think it would be a good idea to produce something similar fortoki pona, or put it in "database", like other groups have (but how wedo that?). I think filling it by posts would be too messy (about 1600words). Do you think it's a good idea? Personnally, I'm not confident enough in my skills to do it... ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile"),
