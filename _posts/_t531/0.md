jan ali, o toki!I was wondering if, since toki pona is a context-based language, the subjectcould bedropped in conversations. It happens frequently in other kinds of similarlanguages, likeJapanese, where if the subject (or context) of discussion is understood then itcan beimplied and not expressed. For example, say I was talking about orcs (jan Uluka= Uruk-hai person?):jan Uluka li lukin ike. jan Uluka li toki kepeken toki pimeja. jan Elitalumoli li pona tawajan Uluka. palisa moli li pona tawa jan Uluka. sijelo pi jan Uluka li pimeja.Orcs are ugly. Orcs talk using the Black Speech. They like the deaths of elves(Eldarpeople). They like arrows (deadly pointy-long things). The bodies of orcs areblack.Instead of repeating "jan Uluka" over and over, since the subject is alreadyunderstood,would it be possible/encouraged to restate that as:lukin ike. toki kepeken toki pimeja. jan Elitalu moli li pona. palisa moli lipona. sijelo lipimeja.Ugly. Talk using Black Speech. Elves' deaths are good. Arrows are good. Bodyis black.In saying things like "lukin ike", would "li" also have to be used? I'mthinking no becausethe subject of the sentence is already implied, so the compliment of the subjectwould justbe there. Same thing with "toki kepeken...". The thing that makes toki ponadifferentfrom Japanese here (and so my logic can fail) is that Japanese uses two versionsof whatwe use "li" for: one to establish the subject of conversation, and one toestablish theexplicit subject of a sentence. "Li" must cover both kinds of subjects, right?But I also thought about the "la" particle. In the phrase "ken la jan Uluka lipini e utala""ken la" sets up a conditional, which I'm translating literally as "if it'spossible." I maybethought that one could set up a conversational context using the "la" particlein addition toif-clauses and time clauses (all of which are really if-clauses."tenpo pini la, mi lili.If \[we're talking about\] the past time, I was small.ken la, mi liliIf \[we're talking about\] possibility, I am small.sijelo kon li ike la, mi telo.If \[we're talking about\] bad weather (state of the air), I am wet.So, by extention, could the following also be ok?jan Uluka la sijelo li pimeja.If \[we're talking about\] orcs, the body is black.Yeah. I'm just wondering. I'm big on using toki pona in conversation. ![:D](images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")\-jan Kasema
