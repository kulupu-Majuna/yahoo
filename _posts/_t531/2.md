>> I don't get this one.jan Pije in his teaching docs of toki pona, when "ken la" was introduced, saidthat hecouldn't fully explain why "ken la" meant maybe. I know I may bemisinterpreting this, butI'm interpreting "la" as a particle that sets the context or condition. So I'minterpreting"ken la" as "if we're talking about possibility," "it can happen that," or inone word,"maybe." Maybe itself is an old relic of subjunctivity in English ("it may bethat...") I wastrying to say in the example here that "Maybe I am small."Yeah. If this post reads a bit convoluted, I was writing this over the courseof 4 hours inbetween an emergency.
