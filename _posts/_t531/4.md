>Why make it so complicated ? "la" and "li" are justseparators. They have no meaning at all. They juststand there to inform the listener or the reader that- for "la", the next word is the subject- for "li", the next word is the verbThe order of words within a toki pona sentence is verystiff :1)general circumstances ; 2)la + subject ; 3)li +verb ; 4)e + object ; 5) other prepositions + nounsdescribing particular conditionsOf course, some parts of the sentence can drop. Whenthere are no general circumstances, "la" drops, too.When the subject is "mi" or "sina", "li" drops. Whenthe verb describes a state or a feeling (and not anaction), "e" drops etc...jan Kanso\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
