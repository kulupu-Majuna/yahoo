Lisa is a TP-ish name; a person who bears this name is Lisa Simpson from The Simpsons TV show.Speaking of The Simpsons, the guy who runs the Quik-E-Mart is named Apu (but the stress is on the U).Ana (although more commonly spelled Anna) is another, although I can't think of anyone in particular who has this name.Mo is a nickname.Numa is part of the name Numa Pompilius, who was an early leader of Rome.Sam Nujoma was (and perhaps still is) president of Namibia.Pepe Le Peu was the skunk's name from the old Bugs Bunny cartoons.The name Milan is used in a Disney movie, and some people have it as a name.Pan is an ancient Greek god. Juno is an ancient Roman god; however, the J could have been pronounced as a Toki Pona J or maybe like in French (or who knows what else), and there's no way to really know which way was most common.My biology teacher's first name is Susan.--
