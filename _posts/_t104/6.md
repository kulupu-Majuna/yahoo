I was reading through the Lord of the Rings today, and I discoveredthat Gimli, the dwarf (who is also an important character in themovies, if you've seen them) has a distant relative named Kili. Iwent back and searched The Hobbit, where Kili is actually a part ofthe story as one of the Dwarves accompanying Bilbo, and his nameappears in the book 37 times.This is quite a special name, really. Not only does it follow TokiPona's word rules, but it is actually a Toki Pona word itself. InTolkien's imaginary world, the name "Kili" was spoken by many, andthus, unknowningly, they were also speaking a real Toki Pona word. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\--
