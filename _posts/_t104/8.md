Out of the approximately 93 882 words in The Hobbit (Icounted the number of words for the first half of the book thendoubled that figure.), Kili only appears 37 times.For every 2 537 words in The Hobbit, he is mentioned only once.Furthermore, he is not mentioned anywhere in the entire Lord of theRings trilogy, with the exception of the appendices. And he's notanywhere in The Silmarillion at all, and I'm sure you know how muchTolkien filled The Silmarillion chock full of names, to the pointwhere it became utterly confusing. ---
 It seems he couldn't have beenall THAT honorable to be mentioned so little.--
