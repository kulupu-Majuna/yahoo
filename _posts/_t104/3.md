I think Mona Lisa might be one of the most popular persons with TP-ish names.Ton Koopmann is a famous organist and has at least a TP-ish first name.Many TP-ish names can be found in literature:Lina is a more or less important caracter in Astrid Lindgren's "Emil iLÃ¶nneberga".In "Siddhartha" by Hesse there's a caracter named Kamala.Momo is the main caracter in the novel of the same name by Michael Ende.And what about "Anakin pi tawa lon kon" ("Star Wars")? :-)Pona,jan Eleni.
