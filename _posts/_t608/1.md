I suppose either of "Susan Wanapi" or "Wanapi Susan" would be fine under theusualmodified-modifier pattern (but then you have to say something like "meli PISusan Wanapi") or thesingle word approach will work, too. In short, there does not seem to be a ruleand any versioncan bwe accomodated (though custom points to single words from the get-go, i.e.not having twopart names --
 but the society is samll just now).---
