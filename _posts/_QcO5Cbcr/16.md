lukin? tomo sona anu meli lili?  
Depending of the context, of course. In English, such ambiguity often occurs, and native speakers do not even notice it, unless a foreigner asks.  
See : "World food conference", e. g. , is it in French : "Conférence mondiale sur la nourriture" or "Conférence sur la nourriture dans le monde" ?If you want to learn a language with as few as possible ambiguity, I recommend you to learn Esperanto rather than Toki Pona.
