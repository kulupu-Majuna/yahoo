often occurs, and native speakers do not even notice it, unless a  
foreigner asks.

French : "Conférence mondiale sur la nourriture" or "Conférence sur  
la nourriture dans le monde" ?If you want to learn a language with as  
few as possible ambiguity, I recommend you to learn Esperanto rather  
than Toki Pona.  
  
Couldn't we just split up the sentences? For example, instead  
of "jan Opama li jan lawa pi nanpa wan pi selo pimeja pi ma Mewika,"  
couldn't we say, "jan Opama li jan lawa pi ma Mewika. ona li jo e  
selo pimeja. tenpo pini la, jan lawa ale pi ma Mewika li jo e selo  
walo." Or maybe "jan Opama li jan lawa ni pi nanpa wan: ona li jo e  
selo pimeja li lawa e ma Mewika."  
  
The reason we use "pi" is because derivational syntax is regularized  
in its absence:  
  
tomo telo nasa = crazy restroom  
tomo pi telo nasa = bar  
  
We could say A pi B pi C = (A pi B) pi C by analogy to this, but then  
how would we say A pi (B pi C)?
