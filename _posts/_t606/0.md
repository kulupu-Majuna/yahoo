Another objection I have is that some Toki Pona words consist entirely of other Toki Pona words: a-la, a-li, kala-ma, li-li, ma-ma, ma-ni, ni-mi, o-ko, pi-ni, pi-pi, uta-la.  The worst offenders here are the words that form repeats of some of the commonest Toki Pona words: lili, mama, pipi.  No Toki Pona word should consist entirely of other Toki Pona words.I suspect that this objections and the preceding one are aimed at the way that Toki Pona words were created.  Namely, they were borrowed from other languages around the world, then modified to Toki Pona phonology.  The etymology of Toki Pona words is charming, but essentially useless information.  At best, it gives a hook or mnemonic for beginners to remember a word.  At worst, it can give that same beginner a false feeling of competence when he uses the word incorrectly or doesn't understand the word when it is used correctly.  This is because the etymology touches only part of the semantic range of a word, leaving the untouched areas to be learned in spite of the mnenomic.  jan Setepo / stevo
