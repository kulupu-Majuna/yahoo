Having written up my trial format for the languages I know best, I am at a loss what to do next. I have some general articles promised but feel ununspired; I want to do another language. I know about some of your personal languages,but these seem to me an ill-advised place to go on to now; do you have any suggestions for languages (preferably NOT auxlangs) I might look at?
