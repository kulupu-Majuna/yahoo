> omitted, but I can't supply it from context. I suppose that "tokie" is meant to be for "talks:-) pakala ni li suli:I meant the context phrase to be something like "(by the way,) (if)talking about bikes". I didn't thought a subjectless sentence to be aproblem. "e" is right, in my opinion, "saying (e) something" (I thinkit is clearer here than the lon/sike alternatives, though it is notthe same nuance as "talking about something"). "pi" came out from mymind unconsciously, because of the pair "sike tu", and of course itis wrong.

I didn't thought about that. And what about using"li" to make it a bit clearer:"li kama la, mi lukin e ni"1) Is it right?2) Does it give any useful nuance over "mi kama la, mi lukin e ni" or"mi mute li kama la, mi lukin e ni" or whatever?jan Mako--
