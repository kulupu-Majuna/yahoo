But, ALL languages are, attheir core, about conveying information. Yes, you may simplify thingsbut if you simplify things too much they become useless. This is oneplace where, by design, you just CAN'T convey the information in auseful form. It is still somewhat useful to say "she likes her animal"because there is enough information there when combined with contextfor the person you are communicating to to figure it out. And I thinkthat that applies to most of toki pona. And that's part of it's fun,you're right. But there has to be enough information conveyed betweenparties for there to be any point in them even conversing.Everyone and everything is made of atoms, and atoms are just made ofenergy, so it could be argued that all you really need is a languagethat describes energy in various states. I don't think it would be avery useful language.There are some places where Sonja has decided to leave things out oftoki pona in order to keep it small. This does not mean that whatthose things are used to discuss are not worth consideration or thatthey aren't things worth conveying, just that they were left out ofthe language in the interest of keeping it small. And that's a veryimportant distinction.toki pona is not capable of teaching it's own grammatical rules andyet we've all agree that they were worth considering or we wouldn't behere.---
