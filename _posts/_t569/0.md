Bedaurinde, mi ne havas tempon por skribi chi-tion ankau Esperante auTokipone. ken ala la mi sitelen pi toki ante e ni. ni li ike.A while back we were discussing the possibility of getting Toki Pona anofficial three-letter language code in ISO/DIS 639-3. I contacted thefolks responsible for the standard and they said they weren't acceptingsuggestions at that time, but that they'd notify me when that changed.So, I got the notification and the relevant forms to fill out. Mycircumstances right now are such that I can't deal with the submissionprocess, but if someone would like to step in I can forward you all thedocuments SIL International has sent me.
