It would be more fun if we got spam for toki pona singles looking forfriendship, pen pal, romance, and more. "toki! meli toki pona li wile eunpa!"But yeah, we should lose the real spam. It seems like spammers aresufficiently aggressive that yahoogroups mailing lists should be configuredto require moderator approval for people to join, otherwise the spammersjust join and post their crap, alas.jan russ
