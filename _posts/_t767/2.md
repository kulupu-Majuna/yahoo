>>With only one anaphoric pronoun, this can get muddling. I guess all the "ona"are the waso suli,except maybe the second (the arrow atacks, and wounds, but, since "pala;a" canmean "wounded" aswell, ...).I take "tawa moli" to be the ongoing process which end in "kama moli" do "dying"or maybe "tawa"has its usual meaning so "travelling while dying.""selo" doesn't do much for "feather," but I don't know a better one at themoment.
