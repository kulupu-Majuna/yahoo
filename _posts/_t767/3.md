Yes, I do agree all the ona makes it muddled. They are all waso suli, though that second one is strange waso suli li utala li pakala - The eagle is struck and woundedpalisa moli li utala li pakala - The arrow strikes and wounds. Some direct objects would help. ona li utala tan palisa moli li pakala. - He (the eagle) is struck by the arrow and is hurt.ona li utala e waso suli li pakala e waso suli. - It (the arrow) strikes the eagle and wounds the eagle.  Perhaps the last tawa moli should be kama moli. There's a timing question here. tawa moli - move toward deathkama moli - come to death, but also "start to death" and "arrive at death". Given that most birds are feathered, selo waso makes the most sense to me.  selo anpa waso perhaps for the actual skin of the bird? jan Eli ---------------------------------
 With only one anaphoric pronoun, this can get muddling. I guess all the "ona" are the waso suli,except maybe the second (the arrow atacks, and wounds, but, since "pala;a" can mean "wounded" as well, ...).I take "tawa moli" to be the ongoing process which end in "kama moli" do "dying" or maybe "tawa"has its usual meaning so "travelling while dying." "selo" doesn't do much for "feather," but I don't know a better one at the moment.
