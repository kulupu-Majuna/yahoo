Interesting thoughts. I'll keep that in mind. My formal Linguistics training only extends to one course of basic Linguistics in college and whatever I've picked up here and there from learning bits of other languages and reading about language construction. It sounds like you've had a lot of study in such areas.jan Eli  On 5/4/07, John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\

Also, the basic rule in S-W work(which half the people in it ignore) is "No material inferences from vocabulary." Navajo's --
 toplay with Hoijer's favorite examples --
 have no basic word for horses although they are central totheir way of life (they call them, as far as I can remember, enemy's dogs). On the other hand,they still have a basic word for canoes, which they haven't had occasion to use for at least 600years. Of course, the latter does say something about where the Dine' have been, but the othersays it doesn't say much about where they are.But, if you are going to build up a novel society --
 rather than report on an existing one, thisseems to be a rational way to proceed (I would recommend putting in a couple false bits justforveresimilitude).
