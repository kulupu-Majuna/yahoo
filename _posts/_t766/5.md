jan Eli o toki!This is, as you may have seen, a huge debate within the Toki Ponacommunity: should we adapt the language to fit us or adapt ourselvesto fit the language? Most people who speak the language will tell youthat you should do the latter, while some (myself included) willencourage the former. You can do whatever you want with it, but someof us are trying to expand the language so that we can talk about more than what the Toki Pona philosophy allows and use more complicatedsentences.The same debate exists in the Latin-speaking community. Some of themfeel that using Latin to talk about modern things insults the wholereason they learned Latin in the first place (i.e. to learn medievaland Roman history), while others feel that modern Latin speakersshould be able to talk about the modern world, so they use phrases ofexisting Latin words--
there's a website of computer terminology inLatin ([http://obta.uw.edu.pl/~draco/docs/voccomp.html](http://obta.uw.edu.pl/~draco/docs/voccomp.html)) and a list ofwords for modern things([http://users.adelphia.net/~florusc/anglice/ansearch.html](http://users.adelphia.net/~florusc/anglice/ansearch.html)). I'm surethis debate exists in any language that currently has no native speakers.I think an IAL would be a great use of Toki Pona, as its smallvocabulary and simple grammar makes it easy to learn. I believe infreedom of speech, so I don't really like the idea that we shouldn'tsay something just because the creator of Toki Pona didn't invent away to say it. Besides, jan Pije's website has video games in TokiPona and it's one of the major ones, so I think if jan Pije is allowedto talk about things found in the world of The Legend of Zelda, Ithink it's all right for us to talk about other things the language"wasn't designed" to talk about.You might find this site useful:[http://talideon.com/concultures/wiki/?doc=TestSentencesAlso](http://talideon.com/concultures/wiki/?doc=TestSentencesAlso), look at the translation challenges at the zompist bboard([http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/](http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/)) in the "Conlangery & Conworlds" section.If you're interested in expanding the language, those will be usefulin seeing what needs work.Hope that helps!jan Sosuwa/Josh---
