The following is excerpted from an electronic mail exchangebetween myself and Justin B. Rye, who let me pass it on to thetokipona list. Rye is perhaps best known for his Espe-Ranto([http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/](http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/)).JBR wrote:

(But what I do want to know is: arethe numbers European-style pseudoadjectival things, or what?)But I'm still waiting to find out how many distinct word classesit's got, or whether its verbs have strict (lexical) valences, orwhat exactly you mean by oligosynthetic (it looks just plainisolating so far) or anything else like that. Ah, there areprepositions... there seems to be an accusative-markingprepositionoid too. It looks like the grammar is making at least acouple of compromises towards familiarity rather than minimalism -the pronouns could all have been replaced by plain nouns meaningthings like "person", the adjectives could all have beensubstantives in apposition, most prepositional functions could havebeen reduced to equivalents of "at the back of"... Oh, and I'msurprised by the reduplication of effort in having bothsentence-initial adverbs and a divider particle before the verb -wouldn't it have been simpler to make <li

Ormaybe it treats them as too complex and does everythingcoordinately? I could mention that one of my favourite exoticlanguages does just the reverse, eliminating coordinate clauses infavour of subordination. "Colin ate and drank" becomes in effect"(who-)ate, Colin drank", with a "nominative case" marker on the"ate" clause as well as on the noun phrase "Colin", since they bothcontain the same subject... utterly unfamiliar, but beautifullysimple once you get your head round it!\[snip\]This reminds me of something I was thinking of putting on the web: asort of phonemic substitution cipher for French that turns it into atotally unrecognisable language, useful for roleplayers:consonants /m n n^ b d g p t k v z Z f s S l r j/become /n r m S f s H x T t k p d g b Z l v/and vowels /i e E E~ y Y W W~ u o O O~ @ a A A~/become /a A & &? ue uE ui ui? e E i i? o O u u?/...so that, for instance <allons enfants de la patrie

Anyway,how does TP do stuff like the following?+ Colin said that he was happy (ah, here's the en-tp entry on "that"... fair enough)+ I want Colin to be happy (maybe "wile e" can take a whole clause as object?)+ Colin likes his dog as much as I like my cat (maybe "and I like my cat the same amount"?)+ I like the present which Colin gave me (I hope it doesn't reuse the question-word "which?")\[snip\]

But even during officelunchbreak surfing expeditions on umpteen-megabit connections I'vefound the one-paragraph-per-page format irritating for anything thatnaturally forms one long text; I'd almost always rather hit the"Page Down" key than click the "next page" link, if only becausethere's no need to hunt around for it!\[snip\]
