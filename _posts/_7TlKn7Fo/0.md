jan ali pi toki pona o, toki!  
   
Some time ago, the problem of using several "pi" constructions in one sentence was discussed. Here are my suggestions for a possible solution:  
If two pi expressions refer to one basic word, they should be separated by "en" as in "jan pi kalama musi EN pi pona mute lukin" = a very attractive singer" (both pi phrases refer to jan). If the second pi phrase refers to the first pi phrase, no "en" is necessary, as in "lon open pi tenpo sike pi nanpa tu la, jan lili li open tawa" (at the beginning of his second year, the baby begins to walk). Here, the first pi phrase refers to "open" and the second to "tenpo sike". Whoever dislikes these constructions is of course free to split such sentences up into two although this would increase the wordiness.
