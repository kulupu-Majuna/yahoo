The article about Toki Pona on the English Wikipedia is gone. Don'tworry too much about this. As you know, I'm writing a big book aboutToki Pona. My work is drawing a lot of publicity from the media. Ihave an interview with Canada's largest newspaper, the Globe and Mail,on Friday.I think over the next year or two, Toki Pona will gain enough mediapublicity and documented notability that they will have to add it backto Wikipedia.Sonja
