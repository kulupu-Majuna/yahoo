I want to point out that there is still nothing wrong with making surethat Toki Pona is frequently \*mentioned\* on the WikiPedia, with linksto related web sites as references.Even if Toki Pona won't have it's own article for a while, we canstill make sure that it gets mentioned and linked in articles for anyrelevant topic.
