I've been thinking: At every possible opportunity, Wikipedia hasworked to belittle Toki Pona. First, Jimmy Wales shut down the TokiPona Wikipedia. Now, a few aggressors have deleted the article on TokiPona, even after we worked to meet their tedious, uncommon demands toimprove the quality of the article. As far as I'm concerned, Wikipediais an enemy of Toki Pona. Unlike Sonja, I have no desire to "add \[thearticle\] back." Toki Pona does not have to integrate itself with thisgroup of people who seem determined to trample our efforts at everyturn. Toki Pona can and ought to stand independent of its enemy Wikipedia.---
