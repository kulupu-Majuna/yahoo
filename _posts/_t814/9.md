Toki Pona can and ought to stand independent of its enemy Wikipedia.There was a discussion on \_Making Light\_ a few weeks ago aboutthe recent problems with Wikipedia, such as its internal conflicts aboutthe kinds of sources required to support articles and what kinds ofarticle topics are appropriate for Wikipedia.[http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008953.htmlI](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008953.htmlI) haven't been involved in Wikipedia much lately, but much of what's saidthere seems to me accurate. Wikipedia doesn't have a grudge againstToki Pona per se, but a significant number of Wikipedia editors aretrying to take a policy for article sources that was developed for scienceand math articles and apply it everywhere. There may also be ageneral prejudice against conlangs involved --
 similar maybe towhat Claude Piron describes w.r.t. people's psychological reactionsto Esperanto, but maybe not.I agree with Sonja that in a few years, if not less than a year,Toki Pona will probably have enough print documentation to satisfythis dominant faction of Wikipedia editors, and when that's the case,it makes sense for TP to be included in WP. I'm not sure however thatSonja's book by itself will satisfy them, especially if it's self-published.A few articles about by people other than Sonja in various magazinesand newspapers will do a lot more to satisfy the anti-conlang people atWP that Toki Pona is not just a few people's hobby.I've been planning for a while now to write something about TP forthe Esperanto magazine \_Kontakto\_. I'll try to get to that finallyafter this summer's travel is over. Maybe others here could writearticles for suitable publications and submit them. John Clifford's talkabout TP will be published in the Proceedings of the LanguageCreation Society, if I'm not mistaken, and that will be a goodacademic source.--
