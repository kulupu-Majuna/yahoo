He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a secondand a third blow with his axe.  When he reached the hollow of thetree, he found a hive full of honey.  Having tasted thehoneycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree assacred, took great care of it.  Self-interest alone moves some men )jan Eli
