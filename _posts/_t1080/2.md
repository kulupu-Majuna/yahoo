As a person who has tried to write a book of this sort, I can assure you thatearly optimistic guess about how long it will take are sure to be overlyoptimistic and , as the project goes along, the time to the end seems to getever longer and longer. But eventually it comes, hopefully not too late to helpand not much after the time given in the last guess (authors tend to stopguessing after a while). o awen e pilin pona tawa jan Sonja en lipu ona.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_From: jan\_sewe <[serge.g@laposte.net](mailto://serge.g@laposte.net)\
