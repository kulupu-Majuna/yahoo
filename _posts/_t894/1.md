It seems like the \`lon toki' vs \`kepeken toki' question could extend to all thewords that actas prepositions. I've tried to work out a series of sentences to test theusefulness of thisapproach. So far you have all demonstrated that the issue can be avoided byeither usingkepeken or pi, so I've tried to do this in each case as well.\[E\]-English \[t\]-toki pona (k)-kepekan (p)-piE1- letter X doesn't exist in toki pona.t1(lon)- kalama lili X li lon ala toki pona.t1(k)- toki pona kepeken ala e nimi X.t1(p)- kalama pi toki pona li jo ala e kalama lili X.E2- I don't want to add more words to toki pona.t2(tawa)- mi wile ala mute e nimi tawa toki pona.t2(k)- mi wile ala kepeken nimi sin kepeken toki pona.t2(p)- nimi sin pi toki pona li ike tawa mi.E3- I don't want to remove this word from toki pona.t3(tan)- mi wile ala weka e nimi ni tan toki pona.t3(k)- mi wile e ni: tenpo kama la toki pona kepeken e nimi ni.t3(p)- nimi ni pi toki pona li pona. mi wile ala weka e ni.E4- French is similar to Spanish.t4(sama)- toki Kanse li sama lili toki Epanja.t4(k)- toki Kanse en toki Epanja li kepeken e nasin sama lili.t4(p)- nasin pi toki Kanse li sama lili nasin pi toki Epanja.E5- I'm comparing English and toki pona.t5(poka)- mi lukin e toki Inli poka toki pona.t5(k,p)- mi lukin e kepeken pi toki Inli poka kepeken pi toki pona.mi tawa,jan Josan---
