>> Matthew MartinVery nice! Yes, the issue is metaphors. We can't get along without them, ofcourse, since, asLakoff notes (at length), vocabulary is pretty much all metaphors (1300surviving I-E words giverise to almost all of English, for example). But, in constructing a language,we can be carefulabout what metaphors we use and not just fall into whatever the pattern is inour home language.To be sure, some metaphors are pretty universal --
 gods are up (at least many ofthe mostimportant ones are) and so the people who rule us, and so on. In the case oflanguages, my ownpreference is to take the language name as an adverb of manner, but I think thetool metaphorsworks well, too. When we move from speaking the language to the features, Istill don't like "in"(although "lon" actually means more nearly "at") but don't know what is better. So I have beenrephrasing things to avoid the issue.As for conworlds, tp has two: the "Daoist" paradise of simplicity and reducedinventory and thepost-Apocalyptic confluence of survivors to hammer out a pidgin. The lattergives more clues thanthe former (we could look for commonalities over the 15 or so languagesinvolved), but neither ismuch help. So we just hash it out until consensus --
 or an overwhelming amountof text on oneside --
 or jan Sonja laying down the law --
 arises.
