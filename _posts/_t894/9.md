>>mi pali kepeken e oko e luka.
>no "e", second "e" 
> "en"This is something I haven't never been sure about after reading Pije's lesson12â€”when issomething considered a head noun? I've been avoiding "en" outside of thesubject, but asyou've pointed out kepeken acts as a preposition here and I can't use " e A eB".Similarly, does "anu" always imply a question? I've wanted to use it like this:mi wile moku esuwi anu kili. if not, is there a way to imply one of two choices in toki pona?thanks,jan Josan
