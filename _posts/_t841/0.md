[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_requests.asp?order=name&chg_status=currentThe](http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_requests.asp?order=name&chg_status=currentThe) language code TOK has been proposed for Toki Pona in ISO 639-3. Ifyou know how to support that proposal, please go ahead and do so.In the meantime, we need to figure out how to add "tp" to ISO 639-1.(In my opinion, Lojban, Klingon, Quenya and Sindarin should have anentry in ISO 639-1 too.)In the meantime, ISO 639-2 allows ART for contstructed languages, butthat is much too vague.Sonja Elen Kisa
