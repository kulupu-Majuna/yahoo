I believe 639-1 and 639-2are closed. 639-3 merges the ISO codes to the SIL-15 codes whichmeant a few changes to each, especially since SIL generally considersconlangs out of their scope. Having a speaking population, I wouldcertainly say that TP qualifies for a code.What I do in my databases for languages with no codes, is to use "art"(or some other macrolanguage code) with a subcode, so for Sasxsek Iuse "art-sxs". The other option is to grab a code in the unassigned"qqq" range and start using it. FWIW: Lojban already has a 639-3 codeof "jbo". Ceqli had a couple of codes but I'm not sure if they wereproposals or actually issued by SIL.
