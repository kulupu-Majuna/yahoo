Hello all:I am following Chuck from the Esperanto version of the Wikipedia. :)For each of the articles that we have on languages, we have a commonspecimen: Our Father, the old Christian prayer. Each article onlanguage includes a translation of this specemen.For four languages, we've been successful at having an MP3 formatfile of someone reading the specimen: Esperanto, English (Americanstyle), Basic English, and Interlingua. We'd very much like to havea Toki Pona reading recorded by someone with a love for the language.I could do it, but I'd probably butcher the pronunciation. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") Wouldsomeone in this group be willing to do this? If so, please let meknow, or simply make the recording and upload it to this group'sFiles section.For your reference, here is the specimen:mama pi mi mute o,sina lon sewi kon.nimi sina li sewi en pona.ma sina li kama.jan li pali e wile sina en lon sewi kon en lon ma.sina pana lon tenpo suno ni e moku tawa mi.sina kama jo pona e pali ike mi. sama mi li kama jo pona e pali ikepi jan ante.sina pana ala e wile ike tawa mi.sina awen weka e mi tan ike.tenpo ale la ma la ken la nimi li pi sina.ni li nasin.Many thanks...Scottredd@interbug.comhttp://interbug.com/pigeon
