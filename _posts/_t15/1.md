Hi all:

I went ahead and recorded a sound file of a reading of the Lord's
Prayer. Hopefully I didn't set back the cause of Toki Pona too far
by mispronouncing it too badly! Feel free to redo it.

You can listen at [http://eo.wikipedia.com/wiki/Tokipono](https://eo.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokipono&oldid=10530)

-->

I enjoyed the sounds of the words coming from my lips, though I
didn't understand every part of it word for word.

Regards
