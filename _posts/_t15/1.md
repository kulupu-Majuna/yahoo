Hi all:I went ahead and recorded a sound file of a reading of the Lord'sPrayer. Hopefully I didn't set back the cause of Toki Pona too farby mispronouncing it too badly! Feel free to redo it.You can listen at [http://eo.wikipedia.com/wiki/TokiponoI](http://eo.wikipedia.com/wiki/TokiponoI) enjoyed the sounds of the words coming from my lips, though Ididn't understand every part of it word for word.Regards...Scottredd@interbug.comhttp://interbug.com/nia---
