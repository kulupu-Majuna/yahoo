SONJA KISA COPYRIGHTED IT! OHNOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\`"If the person is in earnest about thinking the use of Toki Pona is acopyright violation, someone needs a lesson in the applicability ofcopyright law... a language isn't copyrightable. (The title might betrademarked; the grammar, perhaps, could be patented... but notcopyrighted.)I asked about it in #wikipedia and \[\[User:Angela\]\] is now robo-revertingall the removed pages.Mi kama sona e: pana wile ala pi toki Volapuku li moli e toki Volapuku.jan Silaje li wile ala pana ijo sin e toki Volapuku. jan Silaje li kuteala e wile pi jan ali. ona li toki: mi jo e toki Volapuku. tenpo lilikama la toki Volapuku li kama e ala. tenpo pali la toki Volapuku liwawa. tenpo ni la toki pona li weka. jan mama pi toki ijo li wile e tokipi tenpo mute la pana wile ala li ike.Well, I have learned that "copyright" (or call it as you wish) was mainreason for failure of Volapuk. Schleier refused any improvements of hislanguage, nor allowed anyone to change it. He considered language as ownproperty. Very soon the language faded. And Volapuk was in far betterposition than Toki Pona will ever be. Copyrighting is bad idea if authorwants the language who will survive him.jan Sami----------------------------------------
