Itwould be like some of us saying we could use borrowed words like "Inli" as nounsinstead of like "toki Inli" etc. If Sonjaaa didn't agree, we'd have twodifferent schools of tokiponaïsm and a small language divided against itselfcan't stand that way. In the case of Volapük, faced with a creator who wouldn'tchange, people who wanted things different moved on to other languages. I don'tknow whether the law was ever brought into the discussion, though I doubt it;according to the Wikipedia, a reform of the language \_was\_ made--
within a decadeof Schleyer's death, apparently. \*Muke!--
