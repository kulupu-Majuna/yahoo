Forgive my newb question, but I'm trying to work some stuff out to understand this better...  
  
Reading lesson 11 (http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson11.html) I see that you can use "pi" to indicate ownership of something.  
  
ilo ni li pi sina. -- This tool is yours.  
  
  
But... doesn't jo cover this already?  
  
sina jo ilo ni -- You own this tool.  
  
  
Is it a case of having multiple ways of saying the same thing? Will one work better in some cases than others? Or am I just not understanding this very well?
