Rather "sina jo e ilo ni", as other posters  
have pointed out.

Yes; the latter form, with "jo", is the more common.  
The "<possession> li pi <person>" form, though  
mentioned in the lessons, is something I don't think  
I've ever seen anyone use. And it seems an exception  
to the way "pi" is normally used, as a general-purpose  
linking preposition that binds a two+ word phrase  
as a modifier of the preceding word.
