sina toki e nimi ni: As you propose "po" to mean "olin", I would expect "pon" to mean "hate" rather than "lukin".jan ElumutuGranted, but 1) this is a relex of Toki Pona, and Toki Pona has no word for 'hate', and 2) the word space was kind of cramped there.  I wanted the mental state/action words and the sensory words (lukin, kute in particular) to all be together.Another example of an unfilled opposite is "jun" for 'moli'.  Hypothetical "ju" would mean 'alive; enliven, bring to life, come to life', more specifically than whatever the current term for it is (lon, ali?).If anyone follows my intention, but has specific suggestions for improvements, I'd like to hear them.jan Setepo / stevo
