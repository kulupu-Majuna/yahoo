Context is important here, and I think no one will takeme for a cannabis plant when I say "mi kasi nasa" (though they might think I'mso stoned as to believe that I'm a plant ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")\

"ona li jan" means "he's a person", but "ona li jan pona" doesn'tusually mean "he is a person in a good way". pona doesn't qualify the state ofbeing a person, but qualifies the person itself.Similarly the nasa in "mi kasi nasa" can be taken to qualify the kasi, making itmean cannabis. This is then used as a verb, and can thus mean "to be cannabis"or "to do something with cannabis". The context should tell us that the secondmeaning was intended.

So we should use "mi sitelen nimi LON lipu" rather than "misitelen nimi E lipu".I personally like this (with lon) more than "mi sitelen e nimi mi lon lipu",because it suggests a special kind of "name writing" (i.e. signing), rather thanjust writing one's name for no specific reason.sina pilin e seme?jan Makosi.
