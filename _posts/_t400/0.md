> Does anyone know about other (especially non-european) languages?In Swahili, you "pull" cigarettes. But "tawa" wouldn't work very well.In my own conlang (logli), one just "does" cigarettes/weed, and I think "mi palie kasi nasa" should be acceptable as well.I would suggest that all of "kepeken", "moku" and "pali" are acceptable, andthat context should make it clear anyway (though "moku" can confuse someone asit did with me; maybe I just still don't think tokiponaly enough).I don't think that "kepeken" is too much of an anglicism. I consider weed mainlyas a tool anyway.
