> I don't agree. "ona li jan" means "he's a person", but "ona li janpona" doesn't usually mean "he is a person in a good way". ponadoesn't qualify the state of being a person, but qualifies theperson itself.![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") very convincing and I was about to write back conceding that youare right. but thinking further i realised that there are otherthings to be considered...taking point 2, in "ona li jan pona" the verb describes a statewhereas in "ona li moku pona" the verb describes an action. in thesecond sentence "pona" clearly qualifies the action. however in thestate-verb such as in "ona li jan pona" there is no (or, at best,very little) distinction between qualifying the state and (in thiscase) the person. \[i.e. being a person in a good way is the same asbeing a good person\]similarly with point 1, "ona li kasi" is not the same as "ona limoku". while they both mean "it is a plant/it is food". "ona limoku" also means "he is eating" because it is an essential qualityof moku that it gets eaten. i.e. "mi moku" does not mean "i dosomething to moku" it means "i do what one does with moku".similarly "mi jan Inli" can only mean "i am a jan Inli". itcouldn't mean "i do somthing to/with jan Inli" or else thepossibilities would be endless i.e. i love, i hate, i murder, i hit,i kiss, i see, i hear... etc(ok, one can say that smoking is essentially what one does withweed, hence mi (kasi nasa). i personally do not like the use ofcompounds as one word in this way for reasons i have explained,though i might be wrong, but there is one more thing to consider:While the use of context is important in tokipona,so is speakingsimply. and the simplest way to unambiguously describe what you dowith weed is "mi moku/kepeken e kasi nasa."---
