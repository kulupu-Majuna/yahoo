Hi, Toki PonansA while back, I moved my Toki Pona site fromtokipona.esperanto-jeunes.org to [http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/tokiUnfortunately](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/tokiUnfortunately), many people still seem to be using the eo site. This isbad because the eo site is outdated, and I have lost my logininformation to the eo site and can't delete the site, so I can'tchange anything on it.I want to delete the site so that people will quit using it.If any of you know anyone associated with esperanto-jeunes.org, pleaseask them to delete the site. Otherwise, I was hoping someone couldhelp me write a letter in French to the people at esperanto-jeunes.orgto ask them for help in removing the site.Thanks!--
