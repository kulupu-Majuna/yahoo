How about this, for a general sense of 'I must love my country', in the  
sense of "It is good for me to love my country":  
ni li pona tawa mi: ma mama mi li pona tawa mi.  
OR  
ni li pona tawa mi: ma mama mi li lon pilin mi.  
  
How does that sound?  
  
It's been years since I was very active with the Toki, so I'll admit  
I'm rusty, but these ideas occurred to me, and I thought I'd share them  
in case they were helpful.
