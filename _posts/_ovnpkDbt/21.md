I always was disturbed by the two main meanings of "wile" : "ought to/devoir" and "want/vouloir" , it's absolutely not the same.

As noted earlier, tp was founded by some meta-logicians. Rather than looking for very precise notions they took the general one "strong modal" and gave it a form 'wile' (and, of course, "weak modal" and 'ken'). That is "a strong compulsion drives \[subject\] to action/state \[infinitive\]." What that force may be is left undeclared but can be specified -- if need be -- by more prolix means (similarly for "no relevant force works against" and 'ken'). The fundamental logic is the same throughout (though even that claim is open to challenge) but the details differ.
