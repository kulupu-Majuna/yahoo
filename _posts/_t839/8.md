mi mije en jan pona meli mi li mute. mi sona ala e ni.  mi sona e ona sama ni: I am male (a man) "and" my female/woman friends are many.  If this is right, then "en" should be "li".  If somehow "mi mije" means 'male we' (as in 'we men'), then it's just weird, and is a good example of why "li" should be used with "mi" and "sina".jan Setepo / stevo
