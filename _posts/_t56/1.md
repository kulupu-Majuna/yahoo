> Five vowels can still be minimalist.No, a minimalist vowel system should have no morethan 3 vowels. There are many languages thatperfectly make do with 3 o 4 vowels. I see no goodreason to justify an extreme reduction in theconsonant system in order to make the design minimalwhen at the same time keeping an average (insteadof minimal) vowel system. Average vowel systemsconsist of 5 to 7 elements, while averageconsonants systems consist of around 20 to 30.Toki Pona uses a reduced set of consonants butnot a reduced set of vowels, choosing instead anaverage one. Minimalism is thus only incoherentlyand arbitrarily present in certain aspects of itsdesign but, for no good reason, not in others.IMHO, a really minimalist and quite "good-looking"sound system would be:p, t, k; s, n, l; a, i, u
