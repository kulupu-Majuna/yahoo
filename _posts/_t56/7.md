>> See [http://www.geocities.com/vixcafe/lilipu.htmlTwo](http://www.geocities.com/vixcafe/lilipu.htmlTwo) observations:\* Lilipu has a large vocabulary for such a "minimal" language.\* The name "Lilipu" is too likely to be confused with "Lilliputian", where "quinbus flestrin" means roughly "great man mountain" ( [http://www.jaffebros.com/lee/gulliver/bk1/chap1-2.html](http://www.jaffebros.com/lee/gulliver/bk1/chap1-2.html) ).--
