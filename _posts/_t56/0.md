Five vowels can still be minimalist.According to the Guinness Book of Records (1985), the languagewith the most minimal set of phonemes is Rotokas, with 11.Rotokas also holds the record for fewest consonants, with 6.It has the following sounds, including all five common vowels:/a/, /b/, /e/, /g/, /i/, /k/, /o/, /p/, /r/, /t/, /u/.The record holder for fewest vowels is some Caucasian language,with just two: /a/ and /i/. However, though Caucasian languageshave few vowels, they also tend to have dozens of consonants.However, there exist languages with more consonants than theCaucasian languages, as there are more consonants in some ofthe African click languages than there are words in Toki Pona.I vote for keeping Toki Pona at five vowels. Three vowelswould work in another conlang. You can try to fork TP if youhave an idea, but don't expect it to surpass TP in popularity:look at Ido compared to Esperanto.--
