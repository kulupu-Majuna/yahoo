I just looked at my last post (replying to message #4334) and saw what I addedto the replywas somehow lost, sorry about that. It originally read something like this:I misread your original question as being about tawa being used instead of wekain theproposed "lon weka mute tanâ€¦" for "beyond" and broke it into three separatequestions. Isee now you were asking if weka is in the tawa class of verbs. My answer (whichwas furtherconfusing because I forgot to use \`weka tan') was about weka being more of alocation, andtawa being a motion.Yes, weka, as far as most common usage and the lessons show, doesn't seem towork theway tawa does. I'm still too new to toki pona to see the advantages /disadvantages of usingit this way. And looking more closely, I realize I don't know what thedistinction between "lonweka tan" and "weka tan" would be, if any.
