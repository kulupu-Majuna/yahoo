I read some past messages here about numbers. I know the question isrecurrent and it is not clear at all. But right now I have justrealised something that is new to me: What is the reason for a listof numbers to represent their addition, and then, once all of themare added, the result is the modifier??? In other words: Why numbersdon't modify as normal words do? I mean: A modifier modifies\*everything\* before. Why not every single number does the same? Inpractice, that means no addition but --
 multiplication, look:soweli<--
wan = elephant one = elephant once = 1 elephantsowewli<--
tu = elephant two = elephant twice = 2 elephants( soweli<--
tu )<--
tu = (2 elephants) twice = 4 elephantsSo:soweli tu tu tu = 8 elephantsThe problem is that "wan" is useless... But this way to use numbersas normal modifiers has at least one advantage: "pi" can be used asnormal too, just to break the grouping (no need to give it anotherspecial meaning to make multiplications, as I have read in somemessages):At first sight it looks useless too:soweli tu pi luka tu = 2 \* (5 \* 2) = 20 elephantssoweli tu luka tu = 20 elephants too :-)But... we can use "en", as in the special case: "soweli pi jan Wanwanen jan Tutu li suli". So:soweli pi wan en tu = 3 elephantssoweli luka pi tu en tu = the same 20 elephants, again :-)Addition maybe looks simpler, but it works the opposite way Toki Ponamodifies words, don't you think so? That's what I realised while Iwas reading some texts.(Anyway, the use of "en" in this case is not grammatical.)jan Mako--
