By the way, everyone:There have been a number of minor changes and improvements as TokiPona is being refined and used in daily chat. Examples includechanges to the meaning of "kin", the removal of "en", new wordslike "kulupu" "mu" and "pata", and expanded versatility of "la".I am in the process of rewriting the entire Toki Pona lessons toreflect the current state of the language. In the next 2-3 weeks, Ihope to provide you with tool that will allow anyone to master TokiPona.As the chat logs demonstrate, it is completely possible to use TokiPona to talk about everyday life and also for deeper philosophicalconversations about the nature of life.Anyone who wants to fully learn the language and all its currentfeatures and "rules" will have everything they'd ever need to get upto par and join in on any conversation.I am estimating it may take about 25 lessons of the same "bite-size"length as the "old" lessons that are presently on [http://www.tokipona.org](http://www.tokipona.org). Iprefer to teach things in a simple, step by step approach that iseasy for everyone, whether you're a natural linguist or have noexperience with foreign languages whatsoever.ale li pona!Sonja/MarraskuuCreator of Toki Pona
