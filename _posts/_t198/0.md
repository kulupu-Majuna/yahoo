In the past, several people have told me that the TokiTengwar fontwasn't working for them. I never really understood what the problemwas, but I think I have fixed the problem now.If you've tried to use the font in the past, please download itagain. Tell me if it still doesn't work.[http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/tengwar/tokitengwar.zipKeep](http://www.geocities.com/tokipona/tengwar/tokitengwar.zipKeep) in mind it's a .ttf font. So you might need a convertor if youdon't use Windows.--
