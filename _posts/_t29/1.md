>jan sewi = god, deity, priest, holy or magical personI would not define a priest with the same word as a god... that seemsincorrect to me. I would either define the priest or the god with adifferent word... 'jan sewi ale' = god, or perhaps the other way around...'jan sewi lili' = priest.
>sijelo pona = healthThis is not right, because health can be good or bad. It might mean'healthy', but not just 'health'.
>sitelen toki = script, lettersI agree with this, but this implies that other uses of the written wordshould be defined by 'sitelen toki', and not just 'toki' all alone...including IRC. Also, see the paragraph below about 'toki awen'.
>tenpo la ., kama la . = if ., then .I'm unfamiliar with this type of punctuation... is that an approximation ofa semicolon (;) for intl keyboards that do not have one?
>toki awen = written language, book, websiteI understand this reference, but you are creating two conflictingdefinitions for what is the same thing... 'sitelen toki' vs 'toki awen'. Ithink it would be more appropriate to use 'toki luken' for writtenlanguage... speech you see. 'luken toki' would mean 'to read'. I believe'toki awen' would be more appropriate to apply to libraries, places whosepurpose is to preserve knowledge, and books only when used in theappropriate context instead of all the time. 'sitelen toki' seems moreappropriate for picture books, cave drawings, or hieroglyphics... perhapschinese lettering, but that is more of a stretch.Nice list of definitions. Some of course could be more specific... 'tomotawa kon' for 'space shuttle' seems appropriate. It looks at only one aspectof the shuttle and defines it from there. Ambiguities such as this areinherent in the language of course... but if I were making a canonicaldictionary, I would simply not define words that are so rarely used,specific, or ambiguous.For example, 'tomo unpa' = 'bedroom'. The other definitions are good,because they are words associated only with sex. But a bedroom would moreoften be 'tomo lape'. For a child, it may also be 'tomo musi'. By definingit with 'tomo unpa' in your dictionary, you fixate its purpose. Better tonot define it at all, and leave ambiguous words for people to definethemselves, as context dictates. Define unambiguous words, or at least givethe context in which a definition is useful... telling your children to goto their 'tomo unpa' would be rather confusing... possibly even unsettling.Inviting your friend into your 'tomo unpa' (to look at your new poster)could be taken in a rather different way than you expected, with enjoyable,embarrassing, or painful results depending on your relationship. ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")
