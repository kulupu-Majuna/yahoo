As some have noticed, I've made a few changes to my site lately:I have released all of my content into the public domain. I made this decisionbecause of moral concerns and because of my deeply-held political convictions (Iam an anarcho-capitalist). If you would like more details, you may visit thecopyright information page: [http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/copyright.htmlAlmost](http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/copyright.htmlAlmost) all of the pages now have a white background. This looks more fashionablethan the black backgrounds used in the past. Some of the pages also have newer,more aesthetic artwork.I may make other changes to the site in the future, potentially including arewrite of the "o kama sona e toki pona!" lessons. I will post an announcementif I decide to make such changes.Thanks,Bryant Knight
