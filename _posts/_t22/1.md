I do not believe "kute" (hear) and "kalama" (sound) can be collided intoone word. For example, as verbs their meanings are quite different:mi kute e ni. = I hear this. I listen to this.Mi kalama e ni. = I voice this. I make this sound.-----

We use moku for eat and food, why not kute for hear andsound?I'm going through the entire lexicon, giving noun, verb, and descriptivetranslations for every Toki Pona word (as appropriate).Example:ko dn. non-solid or soft substance (paste, powder, gum, etc.)kon n. air, wind, odor, atmosphere, mood, spirit, soul; v. smell, blow; d. airy, ephemeral, odiferous, spiritualkule n. color; v. color; d. colorfulkute n. sound, noise, voice; v. listen, hear; d. noisy, audiblen: nounv: verbd: descriptive, adjective or adverbdn: descriptive primarily for nouns, adjectivedv: descriptive primarily for verbs, adverbp: particle, words used to join sentence parts, or that have any otherpurpose outside the standard 'subject verb object' syntax.Once finished, I'll post it to the files here as both a word documentand an html... possibly PDF if I find someone who can convert it for me.To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:[tokipona-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.comYour](mailto://tokipona-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.comYour) use of Yahoo!
