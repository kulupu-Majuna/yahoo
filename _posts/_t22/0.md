I believe I may have found a redundant word in Toki Pona... who
would have thought!

kalama seems redundant with kute... they are noun and verb of
obviously linked items. We use moku for eat and food, why not kute
for hear and sound?

I'm going through the entire lexicon, giving noun, verb, and
descriptive translations for every Toki Pona word (as appropriate).

Example: \
ko dn. non-solid or soft substance (paste, powder, gum, etc.) \
kon n. air, wind, odor, atmosphere, mood, spirit, soul; v. smell, blow; d. airy, ephemeral, odiferous, spiritual \
kule n. color; v. color; d. colorful \
kute n. sound, noise, voice; v. listen, hear; d. noisy, audible \
n: noun \
v: verb \
d: descriptive, adjective or adverb \
dn: descriptive primarily for nouns, adjective \
dv: descriptive primarily for verbs, adverb \
p: particle, words used to join sentence parts, or that have any
other purpose outside the standard 'subject verb object' syntax.

Once finished, I'll post it to the files here as both a word
document and an html... possibly PDF if I find someone who can
convert it for me.
