I believe I may have found a redundant word in Toki Pona... whowould have thought!kalama seems redundant with kute... they are noun and verb ofobviously linked items. We use moku for eat and food, why not kutefor hear and sound?I'm going through the entire lexicon, giving noun, verb, anddescriptive translations for every Toki Pona word (as appropriate).Example:ko dn. non-solid or soft substance (paste, powder, gum, etc.)kon n. air, wind, odor, atmosphere, mood, spirit, soul; v. smell, blow; d. airy, ephemeral, odiferous, spiritualkule n. color; v. color; d. colorfulkute n. sound, noise, voice; v. listen, hear; d. noisy, audiblen: nounv: verbd: descriptive, adjective or adverbdn: descriptive primarily for nouns, adjectivedv: descriptive primarily for verbs, adverbp: particle, words used to join sentence parts, or that have anyother purpose outside the standard 'subject verb object' syntax.Once finished, I'll post it to the files here as both a worddocument and an html... possibly PDF if I find someone who canconvert it for me.
