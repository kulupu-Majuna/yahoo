jaki. Dodging the restricted vocabulary by adding names for existing sorts ofthings that are notnormally named in the relevant way seems to me to be cheating, since it meansthat there is not arestricted vocabulary, just a restricted class of words not proper names. Wecan get the whole ofthe vocabulary of any language in now by attaching names to the appropriategenuinely tp headword:"iko Konputa", say. And where will we get the standarized names? We can't eachyse our nativeexpressions for all sorts of reasons.---
