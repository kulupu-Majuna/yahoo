Of course, but they are all NAMES in a recognized sense (there was a baptismal event, as it were)mnot some vaeriation on a historically developed non-name (quantifiers in the case of numbers) (Iknow that this distinction is loaded with problems if applied too rigorously, but it rationalizesa raft of intuitive objections to your suggested procedure.)  Surely, if we are to have bignumbers in tp, we can find a native way to do it, with minimal changes (I can't object to "tu wan"being two rather than the historical three since my own favorite form has it as seven).  As aminimal change, note that "u" is unused and so could be drafted for some numerical purpose (theadditive element, say).  This is NOT a recommendation.OTOH, all of the named numbers could be predefined for each, at least until some became more or less standard.jan Setepo / stevo
