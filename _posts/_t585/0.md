4\.  Since "nanpa San" is the name of a number (here meaning 'three'), I suggest using "mute" plus a name as the number itself.  It's still a name, but now it's a quantity referred to by the name.  For example, if "Penta" is a name for 5, then 'five people' would be "jan pi mute Penta".  Another example:  mute Ten tu li tu pi mute Ten li mute Tuten, i.e.,  10\*2 = 2\*20 = 20,where "Ten" is 10 and "Tuten" is 20.jan Setepo / stevo
