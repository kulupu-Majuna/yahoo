Of course, but they are all NAMES in a recognized sense (there was a baptismalevent, as it were)mnot some vaeriation on a historically developed non-name (quantifiers in thecase of numbers) (Iknow that this distinction is loaded with problems if applied too rigorously,but it rationalizesa raft of intuitive objections to your suggested procedure.) Surely, if we areto have bignumbers in tp, we can find a native way to do it, with minimal changes (I can'tobject to "tu wan"being two rather than the historical three since my own favorite form has it asseven). As aminimal change, note that "u" is unused and so could be drafted for somenumerical purpose (theadditive element, say). This is NOT a recommendation.---
