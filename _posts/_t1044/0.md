...which, if I said it right, should mean "I don't know how to speak well." Notsure how I would say "...in the language Toki Pona."In any case...Toki!I'm picking up the language at the moment, just completing the lessons. I had agrammar question though (I'm sure I'll have more... hopefully that's okay forthis forum...)In lesson 11, we learn that you can say sina pali e ni kepeken nasin seme? --
 You made this using what method? How didyou make this?...but, could you also saysina pali seme e niYou made (in some manner I don't know) this? In what manner did you make this?Of course, it's not quite the same question as by what method did you make this- I'm simply curious if it's a legitimate formation.Also...ma li pona lukin tawa mi"the countryside is good looking to me"...is this properly formatted? I'm trying to understand the 'no clause' aspectof the language, but this confuses me. Could somebody point to some examples ofwhich sentences need to be split up when translated and which don't?and one more for the moment...mi mute li pali e wili mi mute tan ken mi mute...we do what we must because we can -?Thanks!~XavierPS: Moderator, I answered my previous question, so you don't need to post it tothe group. Thank you.
