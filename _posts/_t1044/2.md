Well, 'sina pali seme e ni' doesn't seem to mean 'What did you make with this'since 'seme' is not the object of 'pali' but rather a modifier ('ni' is theobject, see the 'e'). So it means something like 'You made this whatly' whereany adverb might be the appropriate answer. That is, it means 'How did you makethis' in the broadest sense' where answers like 'well' or 'expensively' etc.might do. 'kepeken nasin seme' apparently would limit the scope some what: to'by hand' or 'on a lathe' or some such. (I'm not sure this is literally true,since 'well' is a way of soing things after all, but I think the convention isas I lay it out here. 'kepeken ilo seme' is even more restrictive, surely.)The various renditions of 'I don't know how to speak well in tp' seem right,though I would use 'kepeken' rather than 'lon' --
 but jan Sonja goes the otherway. I would probably cut to the chase and just say 'mi toki pona ala kepekentoki pona' (the 'know how to' seems a frill and tp is unfrilly).The remarks here about the vagueness of 'ma ni li pona lukin tawa mi' make apoint always to keep in mind --
 namely, that context always plays a central rolein understanding a tp utterance. In tis case, 'ma' covers everything from thewhole planet to a clod, so getting it down to the present view is hard in asingle sentence.I am wary of 'pi' as a verb/predicate adjective maker. I woulld probably say --
if I were thinking --
 'ni li ilo pi mi' and just avoid the problem.'mi mute li pali e wile mi mute tan ken mi mute' looks overly complex, but thehypothetical form, 'mi ken pali e ijo la mi wile pali e ni,' don't seem to saythe same thing, which seems clearly to require that I do want/have to do it. So, 'mi wile pali e ijo li ken pali e ni. tan ni la mi pali e ni' is better,but still conmplex. I would use 'mi mute li wile pali e ijo tan ni: mi mute liken pali e ijo ni.' (the original also misses the mark some what, sayingsomething like 'we make our necessity because of our ability,' whatever thatmeans --
 I'm pretty sure it is not what anyone intended)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_From: jan\_sewe <[serge.g@laposte.net](mailto://serge.g@laposte.net)\

 You made this using what method? Howdid you make this?

>> sina pali seme e ni
>> You made (in some manner I don't know) this? In what manner did you make this?
>> Of course, it's not quite the same question as by what method did you makethis - I'm simply curious if it's a legitimate formation.
>The sentence "sina pali seme e ni" doesn't really mean "How did you make this?"but rather "What did you make with this?". "kepeken nasin seme" is actually thebest translation of "how". I sometimes use "sama seme" (like what) but it's notas clear.

>"ma li pona lukin tawa mi" is good Toki Pona, but it will be heard with theintended meaning "the countryside is good looking to me" only if you're indeedwatching the coutryside, or if there's a picture of it above your text, or ifyou've already been speaking about the coutryside, and so on. In Toki Pona it'sthe context that makes the meaning. Adding a precision like "ma ni" can beusefull, if not indispensable.You have to split your sentence up when it's too complicated to be expressedwithout a la-clause. And if it still remains too complicated, then just try tosay the same thing in a simpler way.The syntax "ilo ni li pi sina" is a clever invention of jan Pije's, but I'm notsure many of us do use it actually. Most of the time, TP will force you to speakmore directly.\[Non-text portions of this message have been removed\]
