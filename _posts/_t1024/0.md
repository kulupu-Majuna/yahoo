>Hello Joop,I think that the comment linked from the Change request documentation page ([http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2007-011](http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2007-011)) does explain thereason that the request was rejected at that time. As that document states:"If Toki Pona survives the next few years and continues to develop, both inapplications and in user base, then the RA will be open to consider a newrequest for assignment of a code element for Toki Pona."If the extent of active use of Toki Pona is rapidly growing, anddemonstrating a high likelihood of survival, then it is worthwhile to submita new request for Toki Pona (the deadline is 1 September). Document the usercommunity, uses and development efforts in which users are involved. It isevident from my cursory review that some growth has ocurred in that past 15months.With regard to World of Goo (and any other localization effort), andforvo.com, the approach depends on how they handle languages for which thereis no specific identifier. I do not have a specific recommendation, but Isuggest that a private use code may serve temporarily (any code in the rangeqaa to qtz). However, it would only be meaningful within the context of thesystem that assigned it, and as such it cannot be considered a long-termsolution.Best regards,Joan SpanneISO 639-3/RASIL International7500 W Camp Wisdom RdDallas, TX [75236ISO639-3@sil.orgFeel](mailto://75236ISO639-3@sil.orgFeel) free to copy the content of this email to your list group. \*Joop Kiefte <[ikojba@gmail.com](mailto://ikojba@gmail.com)\

>, [tokipona@yahoogroups.com](mailto://tokipona@yahoogroups.com) SubjectToki Pona language codeHello,I tried to call and got somehow to the Ethnologue staff. The person theredirected me finally to this address and to the website, and said he couldn'tgive me the number. So here is my mail.Some time ago we have submitted a form about Toki Pona to acquire a languagecode. The request received disapproval. I didn't see any motivation on thisdecission and I would like to see about that if possible.Now several times yet I wanted to translate something and needed a languagecode (World of Goo,\*[http://tinyurl.com/wogwiki*%3Chttp://tinyurl.com/wogwiki](http://tinyurl.com/wogwiki*%3Chttp://tinyurl.com/wogwiki)\

>)In the first case the webmaster finally decided to use 'tp' as no otherlanguage than toki pona ever uses that code, and in the second case wefinally decided to use x-tp (because of limited space in the databasefields, otherwise we would have used x-tokipona). Now my questions are:- When, which and how should I fill in forms again to apply for this year'sround of language code assignment?- What do you recommend in those cases mentioned to get the languageproperly registered in those systems?(I want to note furtheron that I carbon-copy this mail to several otherpeople. The first one is the person who did the first request, the secondone is the yahoo-list of Toki Pona speakers, to keep them up to date aboutthis. It's however not all Toki Pona speakers who are in there, it ishowever the biggest group known to date keeping contact with each other inand about toki pona.)Thanks for your willingness to pay attention to this mail, and thanks forany reaction soon,Joop Kiefte,appointed moderator of the Yahoo list and fluent speaker of Toki Pona--
