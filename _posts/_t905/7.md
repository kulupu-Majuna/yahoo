What I suggested was not having new abbreviated morphemes meaning the same as old ones, but rather new fixed forms that apparently had an internal relation.  The syllables would not be productive, although if there's a pattern, I suppose somebody would exploit it to create intermediate terms.  Keeping the number of base words to three, the term for orange would still be separate words for 'yellow' and 'red', not a single new word formed from elements of the words for 'yellow' and 'red'.  jan Setepo / stevo
