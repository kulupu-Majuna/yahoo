The color words "loje" ('red') and "jelo" ('yellow') are explicitly mentioned as reverses of each other.  But yellow and red are not in any way opposites.  I'd prefer to see a three-way pattern of words, based on red-yellow-blue (Blue is "laso").To use the same syllables "je", "lo", "so" (leaving out "la", because "la" is already a common word), yellow might be "jelo", red then "loso", and blue "soje".Another possibility is the first syllable as the color morpheme and combine them as we do already: je - yellow, lo - red, so - blue; or jeje - yellow, lolo - red, soso - blue.orange - jelo/lojegreen - jeso/sojepurple - solo/losoI chose red-yellow-blue as the basis, because I think colors formed by absorption (pigments) are much easier to create than colors created by emission (red-green-blue).jan Setepo / stevo
