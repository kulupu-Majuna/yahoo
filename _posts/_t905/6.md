toki! As long as toki pona can name items of a characteristic color, toki pona has no lack of color words. kule mun = graykule suno = golden With some effort one probably could create color names for "tomato", "turquoise" and "wheat" Portmanteaus or tokimanteaus ![:-)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") are not in the spirit of toki pona because they drive up the number of morphemes above ~120. Also, toki pona is strictly oligiosynthetic, i.e. all morphemes are also words, which makes it rather distinctive. toki mi li pini,  (which makes more since than "mi tawa") jan Matthew Martin On 10/8/07, [MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com) <[MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com](mailto://MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com)\

 this schema could work for hue, but I don't know how add information about color value. would you want to do the same with walo and pimeja too? (would pink be walo lolo or walo/lowa)? or would you keep walo for "white thing or part", but combine wa- into color combinations?   jan Josan I hadn't thought it through any further than I already said, but now that you've mentioned it, I suppose I'd just use whatever words were available to create the meanings I needed.  I doubt I'd use just syllables from "walo" ('white') to make 'pink'. Too many color words would just get complicated, though.  As in, un-TokiPona.  My main point was against a connection between red and yellow.  If there's to be a connection between colors, it should be between all the main ones.  Toki Pona color words are based only on hue.  Light/dark, pale/bright are modifiers of the basic color word.  I wouldn't change that. jan Setepo / stevo
