this schema could work for hue, but I don't know how add informationabout color value. would you want to do the same with walo and pimejatoo? (would pink be walo lolo or walo/lowa)? or would you keep walofor "white thing or part", but combine wa- into color combinations?  jan JosanI hadn't thought it through any further than I already said, but now that you've mentioned it, I suppose I'd just use whatever words were available to create the meanings I needed.  I doubt I'd use just syllables from "walo" ('white') to make 'pink'.Too many color words would just get complicated, though.  As in, un-TokiPona.  My main point was against a connection between red and yellow.  If there's to be a connection between colors, it should be between all the main ones.  Toki Pona color words are based only on hue.  Light/dark, pale/bright are modifiers of the basic color word.  I wouldn't change that.jan Setepo / stevo
