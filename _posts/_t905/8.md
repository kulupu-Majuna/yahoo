 fromone to two orthree, but it would leave the number of morphemes unchanged.

Itseems to mean eitherthat words are put together from a few pieces (as opposed to 'polysynthetic'which allows anindefinitely large number of pieces) or that they are put together from a smallstore of pieces,like many "philosophic" languages (e.g. aUI with about 40). Neither of thesenotions applies totp, where words are not put together at all, but given whole and unanalysable. That is, tp is atypical isolating language. The notion that 'jelo' and 'loje' are somehow builtof differentarrangements of the same components is a folk-etymological joke, perhapsexploited for the 'cute'side of tp. Look at the actual etymologies of the two words.
