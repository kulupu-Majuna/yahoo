Use tawa: ilo ni li ilo tawa pali pona. This tool is a tool meant to do good // Äˆi tiu ilo estas ilo por bonfari. 2006/9/12, John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\
>:We have "A kepeken B" for "A uses B" and "C ilo" for "C is a tool" but there seem to be no casesso far where we say A uses B \*for\*, what C is a tool \*for\*. The closest we come is "D E kepekenF" "D does E using F," which, while related, does not really apply (unless we know some patternfor preps becoming verbs or verbs becoming preps without dropping or adding). There seem to be a small range of possibilities:1. For "kepeken" the purpose for which B is used is the object "A kepeken B e G" (which would berelated to "A G' kepeken B" --
 G' shifting G to verb from noun).The same might also work for"ilo:" "A ilo e B" for "A is a tool for B."2. For "ilo," however, it seems more natural to take the purpose as a modifier "A ilo B" "A is atool for B." This woulds also open the possibility that "ilo" might havea prepositional use for atleast some kinds of purpose "A B ilo C" A does B to bring about C" or some such. This would allowsome stop to the spreading area said to be covered by "tawa" (and "lon").3.The third possibility would be to follow English again (but this is always a suspect pattern,"malglico" "bad Englishing" in Lojban) and introduce the purpose with "tawa." Aside from theEnglish element, this also seems wrong inherently, since the notion of a purposed activity orobjects seems inherent in the notion of using something or of something being a tool --
 a tool isalways a tool for some use, using something is always for some further goal.sina mute li pilin e seme. --
