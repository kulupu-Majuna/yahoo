Just out of curiosity, are thereactually natural languages that work that way, or was this somethingmade up from scratch so the syntax would be simple?The way I said it seems simpler to me, but maybe that's just becauseI'm an English-speaker. Besides, you knew what I meant. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") It wouldalso give us a much larger vocabulary from the words we have--
"palisapi kama jo e kala" for "fishing pole," for example.In English, there are things we're not supposed to say on the groundsthat they're not "grammatical" (e.g. ending a sentence with apreposition), but people say them all the time; everyone knows whatthey mean. Because of this, these rules are disappearing.

 until Iunderstand yours, of course."anpa ala" means "below zero." I use "anpa ala" for negativenumbers. So "tenpo sike pi nanpa luka luka tu anpa ala" means "theyear -12," and if we measured years from 1945, that would be the year1933. If we measured years from 1945, how would you say, "1933?"BTW how would we choose what year to start our calendar from? Ifthis is to solve problems with large numbers, how would we solve itwhen talking about historical events (e.g. "Caesar died in 44 BC")?jan Sosuwa
