"palisa

 perhaps as a result --
 more opento ambiguity:"palisa pi kama jo kala" (all structures map into nound phrases --
 to give thema name).

Because of this, these rules are disappearing.That particular rule never actually existed, rarely even for prescriptivegrammarians (in additionto which, the things we use to end a sentence up with are genreally spearableasuffies, notprepositiosn. English is a Germanic language after all.) More to the point,there seems to be noreason to complicate tp grammar right now to accomodate English (etc.) habits:no expressive poweris lost and the sligh added length is more than paid for by othe simplicities.

But the general idea of negative numbers isinteresting (once you openthe gates, ...). I suppose the "below" is pretty natural --
 and "anpa" is notoverworked at themoment.

Of course, there are always Julian dates, but the number get prettybig, even without thedecimals (right now is day 2454225), but they cover every event you are likelyto want to date andall positively.
