Spatial before is "lon sinpin" and I have seen that used for time as well (though I always havetrouble about which way it goes, since it is the things that come later which are before me). There is an American Indian worldview that considers a person to be walking backward into the future.  He can see the past, but not the future.  So whether past or future is "before" is even less clear than at first glance.  jan Setepo / stevo
