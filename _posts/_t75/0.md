If there is anyone who occasionally drops by my Toki Pona pages, I'dlike to simply tell you that the URL has moved.The new URL is [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/The](http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/tokipona/The) Toki Pona pages were quite cluttered under the other directoryand rather aggravating to maintain. Therefore, I moved them to theirown place. Plus the URL itself is much shorter (it used to behttp://[http://www.angelfire.com/empire/almaline/tokipona/](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/almaline/tokipona/)).If you haven't visited my TP page since the last I time I postedabout it, then I certainly encourage you to drop by. I add stuff on afairly regular basis (mostly on the weekends). The new stuff is muchmore exemplary of proper Toki Pona than some of the earlier creationsthat I made while I was still relatively new to the language.Cheerio for now,Pije
