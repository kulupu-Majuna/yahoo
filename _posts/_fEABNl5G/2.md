> Hello! How are you all? I have made a website that is sort of like Twitter, but for speakers of Toki Pona, called Toki Lili. Take a look here: http://tokilili. shoutem.com/ .  
> It's just starting, so there isn't much content at the moment, but it would be great if you would join and help build the community. And if you already have a Twitter, Facebook, Ping.fm, Twhirl, or Ning account, you can have your Toki Lili posts automatically posted to them.
