The first mention in the list of the two sentence conditional, in this case kamala p, tenpo la q(with the double false problem) is in a list of common expressions in message54.the use of nanpa wan without pi is mentioned in 43, in the midst of a longdiscussion of variousthings. This discussion also contains the double en construction for conjoiningcomplex nounphrases.That ala modifies only the immediately preceding word os mentioned in 69, but itis unclearwhether it just \*may\* do that or always \*does\* do that.
