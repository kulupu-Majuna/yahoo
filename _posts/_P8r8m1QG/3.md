Mental exercise? Yes, this is actually what attracted me first. But I really don't know if I'm gonna keep exercising my brain until TP has only the word pona left.

I suspect (on almost no evidence at all) that "eye" and "mouth" are covered because they seem more useful in conveying further notions (though, perhaps many of these could have been handled by "hole" and "see" and "eat" and "light," and so on -- but they weren't). What the vocabulary of a language is is pretty haphazard and in a language without a clearly specified procedure for expanding vocabulary (except "Sonja announces that...") additions need careful consideration indeed (keeping in mind that tp's best feature is its very small size). Once the gates are opened too cavalierly, the flood would soon drown the language ("left," "right," bigger numbers, and a raft of other suggestions come back into play -- along with some suggestions to drop stuff as well). I think the present policy of not adding things is generally best --
