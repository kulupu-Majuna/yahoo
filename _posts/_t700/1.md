"The girl you say I love came." apparently comes over into tp as something likethe following:"meli li kama. sina toki e ni: ---
 olin e meli ni" What goes into the ---
? Ifwhat comes afterthe "toki e ni:" is a direct quote, then it has to be "sina." But that justseems wrong in thiscontext. But then, so does "mi," since, while the quote (or so) is notsubordinated officially,it is not necessarily an accepted fact but only what you think. Is the sentenceafter "toki eni:" generally oratio obliqua or recta, direct or indirect speech? (We coulddistinguish inwriting with quotation marks, of course, but that doesn't answer the generalquestion.) I supposethe answer is, as usual, "It depends on the context" but here --
 and generally--
 the context isof no help and yet it makes a most significant difference. And presumably wehave some way tomake that distinction clearly. (I take it that the sentence after "ni:" isalways indirect,without claim of truth, so ---
 should be "mi." But I think this is just mypreference at themoment, without any clear justitication.)
