The genitive ("possessive") case across languages can convey a numberof different relationships between noun phrases. Consequently, it canconceal a lot of ambiguity.my friend's cup / the glass of my frienda drinking cup / a glass of drinkinga stone cup / a cup of stonea cup (full) of waterThese should all be rendered differently in Toki Pona:my friend's cup: poki pi jan pona mi (simple possession)drinking cup: poki tawa moku telo (purpose)stone cup: poki tan kiwen (origin)cup of water: poki jo teloSo we should we very careful not to render "of" as "pi" in all cases.It depends on the relationship described.jan Pita
