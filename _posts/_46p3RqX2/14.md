Maybe "nasin pona pi jan ali".

Although some "tokiponists" have lists of such idioms. One example is  
translating "cat" as "soweli pi linja uta" (whiskered animal).  
However, I would strongly advise \*against\* using idiomatic  
expressions. Just use the words for what they mean individually and  
try not to be any more specific than absolutely necessary. So if you  
want to talk about a cat for instance, try just saying "soweli".  
  
If there's something specifically feline that you want to communicate,  
figure out what that aspect is and communicat just that. So if you  
want to say that your cat caught a mouse, you might start by saying  
that you have a "soweli" which has teeth and claws. Then say that it  
caught a "soweli" which was smaller. Why go into more detail? Even  
in English, we don't go into details about the breed and color of a  
cat every time we talk about it. Right?
