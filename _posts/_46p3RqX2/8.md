toki "tomo oko" li pona tawa mi. mi kepeken e nimi sama lon  
toki sin mi:  
  
In my personal conlang gjÃ¢-zym-byn, I use a very similar compound word for  
"window": vÄ'ty-rÄ­m, "doorway-vision". (Morpheme order in compounds  
is head-modifier, same as in TP.)

"kalama"  
  
but yes, that sounds clearer.

mute  
  
Otherwise good.

Yes, both are correct. In a corpus analysis I did about a year ago  
(mostly of email messages copied from this mailing list), they were  
almost equally frequent:  
  
0.3863% 40 ali  
0.3670% 38 ale  
  
(The corpus was 10354 words; "ali" occurred 40 times,  
and "ale" 38 times. I wonder if I would get different results  
if I analyzed a corpus consisting entirely of messages from  
the last year or two, instead of stuff spread out over five years  
or so.)
