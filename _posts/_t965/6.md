> as far as ali/ale the dictionary I used gave both as correct.Yes, both are correct. In a corpus analysis I did about a year ago(mostly of email messages copied from this mailing list), they werealmost equally frequent: 0.3863% 40 ali 0.3670% 38 ale(The corpus was 10354 words; "ali" occurred 40 times,and "ale" 38 times. I wonder if I would get different resultsif I analyzed a corpus consisting entirely of messages fromthe last year or two, instead of stuff spread out over five yearsor so.)--
