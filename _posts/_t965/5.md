Thanks for the advice and correctionSo I had:mi lukin e lupa. mi lukin e jan lili mute, jan li musi li toki suli.1st sentence was to be I'm looking through a window. I think mi lukin lon lupa is clearer. I was originally going to put "tomo oko" for window. As I'm learning Polish Oko is eye in this language and okno window so there is a link between them. I doubted it would be clear to anyone else though!The second sentence seems ok because I copied it, so onto the third. As you said, I need to use ona as the pronoun. I had intended it to mean "are talking loudly". Maybe if it was "ona li kamala li toki suli" it would be clearer.The whole story, as was said earlier could be minimised to One li toki li musibut that isn't a lot of practice for me so now the full, revised versionmi lukin lon lupa. mi lukin ejan lili muti. ona li musi. ona li kamala li toki suli.as far as ali/ale the dictionary I used gave both as correct.ThanksSam---
