I just came across this language today whilst doing some research forwork. I thought it'd be interesting to learn and would give me aninsight and make my brain work more. I'm English but live and work inPoland teaching English.I'm no great linguist, I speak English, used to speak good French andprobably have intermediate Polish. My background is in Internationalrelations though which makes me find this language rather fascinating.I like the idea of being able to translate something such as"Universal Human Rights" to something more poetic! Going through thedictionary I found on the web it could be along the lines of 'nasinpona jan'I also like the idea of not being able to perescribe rules, simplyguidelines.One question - is there a list of conventions for compound nouns about?Now for a little bit about me (please correct;-)mi kama sona e toki pona e toki Posuka- mi wile toki pona ![;-)](images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif "Wink"). mi lonma Posuka, mi kama tan ma Inli mi jo e meli olin.Sorry for any hideous inaccuracies, I'm not a fan of being systematic- I prefer just giving it a go.
