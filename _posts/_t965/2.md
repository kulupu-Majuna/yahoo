One example istranslating "cat" as "soweli pi linja uta" (whiskered animal).However, I would strongly advise \*against\* using idiomaticexpressions. Just use the words for what they mean individually andtry not to be any more specific than absolutely necessary. So if youwant to talk about a cat for instance, try just saying "soweli".If there's something specifically feline that you want to communicate,figure out what that aspect is and communicat just that. So if youwant to say that your cat caught a mouse, you might start by sayingthat you have a "soweli" which has teeth and claws. Then say that itcaught a "soweli" which was smaller. Why go into more detail? Evenin English, we don't go into details about the breed and color of acat every time we talk about it. Right?jan Wiko
