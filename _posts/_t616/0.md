Being different is being different FROM something else IN some respect TO somedegree. Where dothe pieces fit around "ante"? Derivatively, then, change is from something tosomething else insome respect to some degree. In this second case, "tan" and "tawa" are perhapsappropriate forthe "from" and "to" but that is less obvious in the first case. I suppose thatboth respect anddegree could be modifiers "ante kule mute" for "very different in color."Quantitative mweasuresdont fit in well here however (if we can do them at all: "differ in temperatureby minus tendegrees"). Since there are no comparatives, strictly speaking, we can't askwhere the "than" partgoes as an analogy for the "from" of "different;" and the two clause approachused forcomparatives does not seem to work for this case. I can't find any usage tosuggest how someonehas answered this question --
 but, on the othre hand, I just came across theproblwem and so havenot really looked. Any guidance?
