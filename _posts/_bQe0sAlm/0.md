Our proposal for an ISO 639-3 language code for Toki Pona has been rejected.  
At the same time, two new codes for other artificial languages have been  
adopted (Lingua Franca Nova and Kotava). On the ISO 639-3 website I  
couldn't find any reasons for these decisions.  
  
The ISO 639-3 website: http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/  
  
The page that lists all past change requests:  
http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg\_requests.asp?order=CR\_Number&chg\_status=past  
  
Does anyone know more about their decision procedures. Are there any chances  
of Toki Pona being considered again (probably only after a few years and new  
progress in Toki Pona's literature).
