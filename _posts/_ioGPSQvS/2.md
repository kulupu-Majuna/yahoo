What you call them may change, depending on what you're trying to say  
about them or what you're trying to distinguish them from.  
  
Try to think, "What's the most important aspect of the dolphin in this  
sentence?" Then use that word as the root of the substantive. Then  
think, "How precisely do I really \*need\* to describe it?" Use only as  
many words as you \*must\* (then think about using one less than that).  
  
If you're saying that the dolphin was leaping and flipping from the  
sea (in a very "fishy" manner), then you can just call it "kala". If  
you want to describe how you felt that ancestral connection, call it  
"soweli kala". If it's hunting fish, you might call it "kala soweli"  
to distinguish it from the fish being hunted.
