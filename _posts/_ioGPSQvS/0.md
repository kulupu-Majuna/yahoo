I've been looking through the lessons again, and I'm a bit confused on  
the animals.  
  
"kala" is "fish and other animals that live in water." So are crabs  
and dolphins "kala?" That seems to be what the pictures suggest. I  
thought they were "pipi telo" and "soweli telo" (or "soweli kala")  
respectively. Or does it work either way?  
  
ni li lon ala lon: "soweli" li jo e linja li pana e telo mama. "kala"  
li jo e selo sama akesi. "pipi" li jo e selo kiwen.
