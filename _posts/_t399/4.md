(I think kepeken is an anglicism which is a throw back tothe use of the word "use" and "user" in reference to drugs - notethat in English you also "use" orally ingested drugs like E). Theword "kepeken" overemphasizes the fact that the drug is a tool(presumably for getting stoned), rather than describe what we do withit, and may be used if this meaning is intended. e.g. "mi wile pilinpona la, mi kepeken e kasi nasa".(a very pedantic but more accurate description of what we do withweed would be "mi moku e kon pi kasi nasa seli" but such pedantry isnot in the spirit of tp?)what do others think?if it helps, in Hindi or Bengali for example, you "drink" cigarettes.Does anyone know about other (especially non-european) languages?btw, what I was trying to say after having read Marcos' chef d'oeuvrewas:"WTF are you on? let's have some!" he hejan Anjo
