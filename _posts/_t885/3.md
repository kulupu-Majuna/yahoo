toki,
>jan ali li toki ala kepeken ona.Oops, at the time I thought I was doing a double negative. No one speaks them anymore."jan ala li toki ala kepeken ona"Does tp use double negatives?
>mute la jan mute pi toki moli li toki ala kepeken toki ona.I was trying to say, "often, people who know dying languages don't \[even\] speak their own language."maybe it would be clearer as:"tempo mute la jan mute pi toki moli li toki ala kepeken toki pi ona sama."(sama added to indicate I'm referring back to "jan mute" and not some other "them")
>jan mute pi toki moli li lon lon ma \*pi\* lawa ike.Okay, that's fine too.  I guess the next obvious question is how to deal with  prepositional phrases that modify something other than the verb phrase?I fed Dr Seus's cat in the hat(?) mi li pana moku e soweli tomo pi jan "Seus" lon len lawa.(?) mi li pana moke e soweli tomo pi len lawa pi jan "Seus"I watch tv in the basement in my underwear.(?) \*lon len anpa la\* mi lukin e sitelin tawa lon tomo anpa (?) mi \*lon len anpa\* li lukin e sitelin tawa lon tomo anpa(?) mi lukin e sitelin tawa lon tomo anpa \*lon len anpa\*I suspect that the following is correct, albeit repetitious and not quite the same (it sounds like a sequence of activities):mi lukin e sitelin tawa lon tomo anpa. mi len e len anpa taso.mi tawa tan sitelin tawa lukin,jan Matthew MartinOn 9/20/07, John E Clifford <[clifford-j@sbcglobal.net](mailto://clifford-j@sbcglobal.net)\

> jan mute pi toki moli li lon lon ma kepeken lawa ike.Don't need second "lon", it's inherent in the first. Strictly, the "kepeken" phrase modifies thewhole sentence, not "ma," as I assume you intended. Just use "pi."
