I think you're asking whether or not one can use "sina mute" to indicate more than one person. Yes you can, but like all other TP things, you don't HAVE to use the mute if context indicates otherwise.You understood my question perfecly Thanks again.hmm... I would say Nachete = Nakete or Nasete, choose which you like. That's the closest to your name. You could also switch up the letters and vowels a bit if you want something a little different. It's your choice. Do what you think sounds best.Nakete sounds good nimi mi li Nakete.mi tawajan Nakete----------------------------
