> mi tawa!hmm... very nice job! Nice to meet you Nachete! Here's a few thingsthat need to be changed:kawa = kaMaIf you're trying to say, "it is a good language", then I personallywould say "ona li toki suwi". This isn't a big deal though.After "kepeken", an "e" isn't needed. You're using it as a prepositionrather than a verb. If you wanted to say, "I use toki pona", then youwould say "kepeken e". But since you're saying "I talk ... using tokipona" then no "e" is needed. :)Very nice job!

Yes you can, but like all other TP things, you don't HAVE touse the mute if context indicates otherwise.

> 3rd - Could you, please, give me a "tokiponized" name? ;-)hmm... I would say Nachete = Nakete or Nasete, choose which you like.That's the closest to your name. You could also switch up the lettersand vowels a bit if you want something a little different. It's yourchoice.
