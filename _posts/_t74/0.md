As I was riding sleepily home from the state fair earlier today, theidea of how one might say "sometimes" in Toki Pona simply popped inmy head without thinking about it. (Honestly.)Anyhow, this is what was popped so effortlessly into my head: "tenpoale ala." A semi-literal translation would be "not all the time".Let's look at this logically:1. If the speaker wanted to simply say "never," he would say "tenpoala." While my proposed phrase could perhaps mean "never," it justdoesn't seem all that likely to me. The speaker would opt for themore sensible "tenpo ala," if he needed to say "never".2. Since my proposed phrase doesn't mean "never," then, obviously,whatever is happening is... happening. (Duh). And, since the phrasemeans "not all the time," then, of course, I think the phrase wouldmean that the action does indeed occur, but not all the time, whichis, of course, only some of the time, which is "sometimes". (Yay! Youreached the end of my tedious explanation without suffering anystrange medical symptoms.)I hope I didn't befuddle anyone with my poor, confusing "explanation"of my proposal. At any rate, I was wondering what other peoplethought of this proposed idea of how to say "sometimes". --
