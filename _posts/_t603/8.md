 There are exceptions, e.g. one reading of "ona li pana e tomotawa mi" ("he gave my car" rather than "He gave a building to me" --
 is that also "ona li pana mie tomo"?).  I don't really think there is a rule; the string just admits of two different parsesand we have to sort it out by context or punting.The first one is genuinely ambiguous, as you say, but the second one is odd, to say the least.  I've never seen "mi" used to modify a verb, and although it's a modifier, and not distinguished between adjective and adverb, I doubt it has an adverbial function (yet).  If the second sentence \*is\* allowed, then the modifier function of the pronouns may correspond to the indirect object when there's a direct object.  jan Setepo / stevo
