Oh yeah, "kama" means "cause" rather than "happen" and I suppose is subject to the "general rule"that vt from vi is agentive (so does it work for "sike," too?). Can you really say " tenpo pona}(tawa mi) mute)" rather than  "tenpo pona) mute} (tawa mi))?""kama" can mean either "happen" (intransitive) or "cause" (transitive), can't it?I don't know of any way to get "tenpo pona (tawa mi) mute".  There seems to be no way (a la Lojban terminators) to create this kind of structure.jan Setepo / stevo
