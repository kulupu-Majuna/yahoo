Oops. Mine might (would?) link the "tawa mi" with "kama" rather than to "pona."This is probablyjust an amphiboly. Note that "tawa mi" is surely a unit even in yours, ratherthan " many of mymoving good times." Another case where we need a rule (or is it just always with"tawa" and "lon"and probably a few other, the "prepositions"?)---
