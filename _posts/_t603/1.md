These are very rough stabs in at least the twilight. corrections eagerly sought.wile: A li wile B e C. A strong force is driving A to bring about A li B e C(force may be moral,psychological, physical, societal, ..., and may be resistable to any degree). If B is omitted nonanaphorically, it is usually "jo" in a broad sense; alternately, the targetsituation is "C lilon"ken: A li ken B e C. No force is blocking A from bringing about A li B e C. Itis presupposedthat the speaker has considered this target situation. B can apparently not beomitted except inanaphora.There is no hint that A will move toward the target situation.open: A li open B e C. A does something that initiates the situation A li B e Cor C li B. If Bis iomitted it is the "natural" action/property for C. The doing may be minimal.Note this may bein any tense.pini: A li pini B e C. A does something that brings to an end A li B e C or Cli B. The doingmay be minimal. Unstated B is the contextually "natural" for C. This may be inany tense.kama: A li kama B e C. Situation is chamgimng to one in which A li B e C istrue. If C ismissing and B is a potential location, what is true may be A li lon B. It isunclear what A likama e C means, unless it is the normal form for "A comes to C" in a locationalsense.
