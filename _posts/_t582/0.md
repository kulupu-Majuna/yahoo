A consistent interpretation of a string of number words would be multiplication.  "tu wan" would mean 'one two' or 'one pair' or 'a pair' or simply 'two'.  "tu tu tu" would mean 2\*(2\*(2)), or 8.  "tu tu" would still mean 4, but its interpretation would be 2\*2 instead of current 2+2.  Any power of 2 can be expressed this way, simply by repeating "tu".  Thus 16 = 2^4: "tu tu tu tu".  1024 = 2^10: "tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu".  Counting the "tu"s becomes unwieldy, and, as I show next, unnecessary.Another consequence of this adherence to consistency is that "pi" must be used before all multiword numbers.jan Setepo / stevo
