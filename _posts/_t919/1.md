It does occasionally mean 'life' in the "That's life" sense of how things go, the way of the world, but it is not clear that this is other than its meaning of 'existing, real,' not obviously 'alive' in the biological sense.  To be sure, we probably do need a short way of saying this; 'moli ala' seems wrongheaded. li mute mute li pakala e jan. jan meli mute li jo e pakala ni lon nena pi telo mama.tenpo suno ni la kulupu pali pi kama sin "BBC" li toki e ni : kasi nasa li ken pona e pakala ni ("Cannabis can halt breast cancer").mi pilin e ni : jan li pilin ike la kasi nasa li ken kin pona e kon jan.jan Kanso Be a better sports nut!
