They are a strange people. Theylight their cities at night, as if the stars weren't sufficient fortheir needs. They fight and kill each other, not realising thegreater danger beyond their small world. And they do not hunteachother with bows and arrows. No, they have strange devices thatkill from far away without arrows. And take care near their strangeiron horses they use to travel. They travel faster than any naturalbeast ought to, and ignore the strength of the bow and arrow. Best ifyou avoid their cities, my son.Father, whats a city?jan Sosuwa
