Hi, Dave!  
  
I have tried to translate your toki pona poem translation back to  
English \*before\* looking at the English original.  
Sorry if my toki pona competency is not high enough to get to the  
hidden meaning, but I hope you find it helpful.

> moli li ala.  
> 

Death is nothing.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> mi tawa tomo poka.  
> 

I go to the near building (room?).  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> tenpo pini la seme mi mute li lon.  
> 

In the past, what mine (multiple my things) were.  
(\* This feels a little bit ungrammatic, as there is no question.  
Or where you intending "what of us" or something like that? \*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> mi mute li lon kin.  
> 

We exist indeed.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o toki e mi kepeken nimi mi.  
> 

Please talk to me my name.  
(\* I think you were trying to say "please call me by my name",  
and if that's true, "o nimi e mi kepeken nimi mi" seems a bit better \*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o toki pona pali e mi.  
> 

Report to me.  
(\* or is that something like "recite to me"? \*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> sama tenpo pini la o pana e kon pi pilin pona.  
> 

In the moment of past, give me an air of good feeling!  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o musi. o pali e sinpin pona.  
> 

Enjoy yourself! Make a good face.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o pilin e mi.  
> 

Feel me! (\* or "Think of me!" ?\*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o toki tawa jan sewi sike mi.  
> 

Talk to my round god!  
(\* Sorry, I could not get what "round god" means \*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o toki e nimi mi lon tomo.  
> 

Please tell my name in the house.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> o toki pona pali e nimi mi.  
> 

Please recite my name.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> ali li lon sama. ali li awen. ala li tu.  
> 

Everything is the same. Everything stays. Nothing splits.  
(\* Or was that "nothing changes" intended? In that case, how about  
"ala li kama ante"? \*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> sina lukin ala e mi. o awen e mi lon lawa sina.  
> 

You don't look at me. Please remember me.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> tenpo lili la mi awen tawa sina.  
> 

(\* or is that "I will prevent you from moving" i.e. "I will  
bind/stop/set at rest you"?  
If so, how about "mi awen e tawa sina" or "mi awen tawa e sina"?  
Anyway, it is entirely unclear to me if it is reasonable to use "tawa"  
as modifier in places where it looks like a preposition and require  
reader to deduce from context.  
"e" is binding stronger than "tawa", so using "e" would resolve the  
parsing ambiguity \*)  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> mi lon poka.  
> 

I am near.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> ali li pona. ala li lon tenpo pini. ala li weka.  
> 

Everything is okay. Nothing is in the past. Nothing will leave.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> tenpo kama la ali li pona mute.  
> 

Everything will get much better.  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> tenpo kama la mi mute li lon poka jan sewi.  
> 

We all will come to god.  
  
\-----  
Now that I have completed line by line translation, I will try to  
rephrase the whole passage as far as my understanding permits.  
  
  
Death is nothing.  
I go to the nearby building.  
In the past, I had many things. We existed indeed.  
Please call me by my name. Recite to me.  
In the moment of past, give me an air of good feeling!  
Enjoy yourself! Smile! Think about me! Talk to my round god!  
Please tell my name in the house. Please recite my name.  
Everything is the same. Everything stays. Nothing splits.  
You don't look at me. Please remember me.  
Soon I will put you to rest. I am near.  
Everything is okay. Nothing is in the past. Nothing will leave.  
Everything will get much better.  
We all will come to god.  
  
\----  
Now comes the moment for me to look at the English original  
and enjoy a rare moment of comprehension :)  
  
Wow! At least I was close with "pray" :)  
Thank for the interesting translation!  
Salikh.
