Hi, Dave!  
  
I have tried to translate your toki pona poem translation back to  
English \*before\* looking at the English original.  
Sorry if my toki pona competency is not high enough to get to the  
hidden meaning, but I hope you find it helpful.

Death is nothing.

I go to the near building (room?).

In the past, what mine (multiple my things) were.  
(\* This feels a little bit ungrammatic, as there is no question.  
Or where you intending "what of us" or something like that? \*)  
  
  
\*ken la ona li wile e kulupu 'pi mi mute' - looking for general "whatever" rather than question "what" (some ancient proto Indo-European has a lot to answer for). Incidentally, I suspect he really means 'mi tu'

We exist indeed.

> 

Please talk to me my name.  
(\* I think you were trying to say "please call me by my name",  
and if that's true, "o nimi e mi kepeken nimi mi" seems a bit better \*)  
\*Real problems here: I guess "talk to me" is 'toki tawa mi' but 'nlml' as a transitive verb comes up short: is "name X 'Y'" 'nimi e nimi 'Y' tawa X' or 'nimi 'Y' e X'. Good cases can be made either way and I can't find an example.

Report to me.  
(\* or is that something like "recite to me"? \*)  
\*I don't get this one either.

> sama tenpo pini la o pana e kon pi pilin pona.  
> 

In the moment of past, give me an air of good feeling!  
  
\*Don't forget 'sama': "as in the past". 'kon pi pilin pona' has been used for "laugh".

Enjoy yourself! Make a good face.  
  
\*"Smile"

> o pilin e mi.  
> 

Feel me! (\* or "Think of me!" ?\*)  
  
\*Again, How do we say that latter?

Talk to my round god!  
(\* Sorry, I could not get what "round god" means \*)  
\*Trying to solve the "talk about" problem with the English pattern, i.e., 'sike' is a preposition here.

Please tell my name in the house.

Please recite my name.

Everything is the same. Everything stays. Nothing splits.  
(\* Or was that "nothing changes" intended? In that case, how about  
"ala li kama ante"? \*)  
\*Nice.

> sina lukin ala e mi. o awen e mi lon lawa sina.  
> 

You don't look at me. Please remember me.  
  
\*Probably "see"  

> [_Post by daraffa_](/TVAOGuC5/dave-s-writing-exercises-4#post1)  
> tenpo lili la mi awen tawa sina.  
> 

(\* or is that "I will prevent you from moving" i.e. "I will  
bind/stop/set at rest you"?  
If so, how about "mi awen e tawa sina" or "mi awen tawa e sina"?  
Anyway, it is entirely unclear to me if it is reasonable to use "tawa"  
as modifier in places where it looks like a preposition and require  
reader to deduce from context.  
"e" is binding stronger than "tawa", so using "e" would resolve the  
parsing ambiguity \*)  
\*I gather 'tawa' is a preposition here "waiting for you." This ambiguity, with 'tawa' at the end of objects is ever present.

I am near.

Everything is okay. Nothing is in the past. Nothing will leave.

Everything will get much better.

We all will come to god.  
  
\*Just "be with'  
\-----  
Now that I have completed line by line translation, I will try to  
rephrase the whole passage as far as my understanding permits.  
  
Death is nothing.  
I go to the nearby building.  
In the past, I had many things. We existed indeed.  
Please call me by my name. Recite to me.  
In the moment of past, give me an air of good feeling!  
Enjoy yourself! Smile! Think about me! Talk to my round god!  
Please tell my name in the house. Please recite my name.  
Everything is the same. Everything stays. Nothing splits.  
You don't look at me. Please remember me.  
Soon I will put you to rest. I am near.  
Everything is okay. Nothing is in the past. Nothing will leave.  
Everything will get much better.  
We all will come to god.  
  
\----  
Now comes the moment for me to look at the English original  
and enjoy a rare moment of comprehension :)  
  
Wow! At least I was close with "pray" :)  
Thank for the interesting translation!  
Salikh.
