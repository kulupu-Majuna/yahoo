Additionally, most languagesconsider the month names as normal nouns rather than proper names. Spanish andEsperanto, for example, both write them with small letters. So no reason toconsider them proper names in Toki Pona. It was just an idea. Ihad two reasons:I NEED to translate a calendarI hoped that it is better to create not names, butdescriptions of months. Yes, it is really highly culture-dependent. And I’mtrying to make it less dependent. And I need help. ![:)](images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile") When we speak in tokipona, we are learning to see an essence of everything. I was just trying tofind essences of months. jan Josa
