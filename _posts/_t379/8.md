Toki pona is not a language ofaccuracy - the calendar is an artificial construction and its precisionis too much for TP to handle gracefully.It may be appropriate to create concepts such as "early spring" and"late spring" if one would like to be more specific.However, this does also have the globalization problem. Tropicalregions do not experience the same kind of seasons as areas closer tothe poles. And of course the seasons do not happen at the same timearound the globe.jan Greghttp://hewgill.com
