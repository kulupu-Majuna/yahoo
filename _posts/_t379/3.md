>lengthy words?Sorry if I am asking newbie questions. The point of toki pona isnot to use “lengthy” words. Of course, you can say “ilo kiwenpi sona nanpa” for “a computer”, but that would mean that youdon’t see the essence of a computer. Say just “ilo” when youtalk with someone behind you, or “ilo sona”, if you’re speakingon the phone. How would someone understand that it is a computer, and not anabacus? Only from a context.If your first phrase is “toki!mi kepeken e ilo nanpa”, we will understand that you use something thatcontains numbers, or knows about the numbers. And we don’t need to knowif this is a calculator or an abacus. Because it doesn’t matter. Toki ponais used to bring goodness and simplicity. So, the answer is: don’tuse lengthy words without necessity. jan Miku wrote:
