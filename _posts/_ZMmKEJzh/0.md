Now people are scared in America. There is little money. Many people do not have jobs. One cause is this: people do not have money. Many people wished to own houses. The government told banks to loan them money. The people bought houses. But the people could not pay for the houses. The banks took the people's houses. The banks stopped lending money. Some banks closed. Stocks fell. (value of buisness paper fell) Some business leaders make much money. This is not good.  
  
People cannot buy cars. The car companies are going out of business. The government is taking banks and car companies. This is not the American way.
