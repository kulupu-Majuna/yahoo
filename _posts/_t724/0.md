There are 2 factions in this community. - The first faction wants simplify toki pona, and use it as languagefor thinking. - The second faction wants convert toki pona to convenient tool forcomunication.The goals of this factions are opposite. Supporters of simplificationoverpower the opponents in this community.I propose to split toki pona in 2 branches (or dialects): branch forthinking and branch for comunication. And I propose to organise anothercommunity for people who want to use toki pona for contacts with otherpeople.It would be possible making good number system and adding some newwords and grammatical structures in such new community.
