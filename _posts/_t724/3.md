I just want toki pona to stay a simple language for simple communication; and I want to use it myself for simple communication. But I do not want to simplify it. Indeed,Â  I haven't encountered anyone in this community who wants to further simplify Toki Pona.Maybe one can say something like this: There are two fractions in this community. The first wants to keep Toki Pona as simple as it is now (for whatever reasons), the second wants to expand Toki Pona in such a way that it suits modern communication better, even if this makes it more complicated.I would consider myself a member of the first faction then. I don't totally oppose the addition of a few (up to ten) new words to Toki Pona, in order to make it suit modern communication better. But I would not accept any grammatical changes, nor any larger additions to the vocabulary. If there are actually people who intend this, they are of course allowed to get on with their project, but they should no longer call it Toki Pona.jan Moku.
