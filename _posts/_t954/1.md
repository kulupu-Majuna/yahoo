As you probably guessed from that fact that I like Toki Pona, I reallyenjoy conlangs. So I like to look at what other conlang groups are doing.There's a huge page of texts translated into Lojban here:[http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Texts+In+Lojban&blNow](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Texts+In+Lojban&blNow), I realize that Lojban and Toki Pona have somewhat oppositephilosophies (hence jan Pije's "jan Lojban" jokes). But the Lojbancommunity has done community translations of things as big as theBible and Alice in Wonderland. I'm also learning Laadan, and one ofthe more experienced speakers and I are working on a collaborativetranslation of Super Mario World together.It seems that not much is going on in this group, so I was wonderingif anyone would be interested in having at least some of us work on atranslation of a large project. (I'm really impressed that jan Pijetranslated an entire movie script!) I'd be open to suggestions as towhat we could translate...jan Sosuwa
