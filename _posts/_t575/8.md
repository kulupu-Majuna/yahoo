I think not.as I said, evolution of the language is needed and crucial in order tokeep this magnificent language alive.AGAIN - without hurting its fundamentals and without destroying itsinner beauty...I think some people misunderstood me - by "evolving" I mean inventingbeautiful things such as "tomo tawa telo" etc, combinations that areintroduced in the official site...It is not the antithesis and we can do it without damaging thesimplicity of the language - Think about it...
