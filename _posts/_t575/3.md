3. Lastly and most importantly, Toki Pona is not about finding some clever way to say big numbers. It's about not saying big numbers. Your suggestion--
along with others I have seen that are similar to yours--
would mutilate the language to achieve goals (such as the ability to say big numbers) that Toki Pona was very deliberately designed to prohibit. What good will it be to say big numbers in Toki Pona if Toki Pona's underlying principles are destroyed in the process? It won't be any good. If we lose sight of the principles of Toki Pona, the language and its intended goals will already be dead; at that point, whether or not we can say big numbers will be basically be irrelevant.--
