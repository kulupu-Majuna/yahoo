Maybe you guys are right.But regardless of big numbers: I think that as any other language - TPshould evolve and we, as TokiPonans are obliged to constantly tryingto think about new ways of saying things without denying or damagingthe foundations on which TP is built.I think this forum should be the place where we suggest new ideas,that hopefully will not hurt TP's concepts.
