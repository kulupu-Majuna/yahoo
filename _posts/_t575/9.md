>:I think not.as I said, evolution of the language is needed and crucial in order to keep this magnificent language alive.AGAIN - without hurting its fundamentals and without destroying its inner beauty...I think some people misunderstood me - by "evolving" I mean inventing beautiful things such as "tomo tawa telo" etc, combinations that are introduced in the official site...It is not the antithesis and we can do it without damaging the simplicity of the language - Think about it...
