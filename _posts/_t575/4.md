maybe you are right.but regardless of big numbers: I think that TP should, like any otherlanguage, evolve. We, as Tokiponans, should not be intimidated byruining or betraying the basic concepts on which the language isbuilt. We can create and further build this language through thisforum by suggesting new and more efficient (although it doesn't soundtoo much TokiPonan) ways of saying things. I think it will onlycontribute to the language...
